					<p>On Monday May 11, 2015, Margaret Watson presents the Dewsbury Tapestry to the Rector
					of Dewsbury the Reverend Canon Kevin Partington at Dewsbury Minster unveiled by John
					Flowers.  The rare and beautiful tapestry which almost ended up in a jumble sale is
					now on display in Dewsbury Minster Church after being saved and restored by Dewsbury
					journalist Margaret Watson, who presented it to the church. The unveiling ceremony was
					organised by the Mother’s Union, who have been doing great work in the district
					supporting parents who have lost children.</p>
					<p>John and his cousin, Perry Exley, of Winnipeg, Canada, have helped Margaret
					enormously over the years in her research on the tapestry.  They still continue
					to do so and have presented a book to the Minster containing all their findings,
					including a family tree of the Imeson family going back many generations.  When
					the unveiling took place before a packed audience at the Minster, she said the
					tapestry had finally come home.  “But it wasn’t me who found the tapestry,” she
					said. “It was the tapestry which found me.”</p>
					<p>The tapestry was created 150 years ago by Sarah Ann Imeson, in memory of nine
					of her children who died in infancy between 1855 and 1871. The names of the children
					and where they were buried are embroidered on the unique piece of art.</p>
					<p>Margaret explained that Sarah Ann’s children were buried in the churchyard
					of Dewsbury Parish Church, now known as Dewsbury Minster.  “These little children,
					like hundreds of others who died in infancy in Dewsbury, were buried in pauper’s
					graves without headstones,” said Margaret.  “But I think this tapestry, created
					out of a mother’s love for her children, will be a legacy for them also.”  The
					tapestry was unveiled  at the church when Margaret gave a well-attended talk
					about the background of what is now being called The Dewsbury Tapestry.</p>
					<p>Margaret said there had been many twists and turnings in the life of the Imeson
					Tapestry but it had now returned to where she believed Sarah Ann and Christopher
					would have wanted it.  It was in a place where their children had lived their lives,
					no matter how brief, but the tapestry bearing their names had at last come home.</p>
					<p>The Reverend Kevin Partington said the tapestry was a valuable piece of social
					history and the Minster was proud to accept it.</p>
