					<p>It was the summer of 1855, when Christopher Imeson met Sarah Ann Allinson while Sarah Ann was
					visiting her parents in Mickley, north-west of Ripon.  Sarah Ann was returning home from Artlington
					House where she had worked for several years, while Christopher was visiting from his home at Birkby
					Nab, before he moved south to the Dewsbury area.  They quickly established a relationship together,
					as they both had something in common; Sarah Ann was a house servant while Christopher was a farm
					servant.</p>
					<p>Christopher Imeson had been born in Masham on April 24, 1829.  His parents were Robert Imeson
					and Elizabeth Wright, who were married May 24, 1828 in Masham.  Christopher was their oldest child.
					By 1851, Christopher was a farm labourer servant living at Birkby Nab, an ancient homestead and
					farm-house which was a portion of the Studley Royal estate, in the township of Studley Roger, liberty
					and parish of Ripon; 2 miles from Ripon.  It was for many years tenanted by the family of Greaves.</p>
					<p>Sarah Ann Allinson had been born in Dallowgill on January 21, 1830.  Her parents were John
					Allinson and Phillis Ashby, who were married November 23, 1826 in Kirkby Malzeard, North Yorkshire.
					Sarah Ann was baptized on February 3, 1830 at Coltsgate Hill Wesleyan Methodist Church in Ripon,
					North Yorkshire.  In 1832, Sarah Ann’s brother Robert was born in Dallowgill. By 1835, the Allinson
					family had moved to Boroughbridge, a small village south-east of Ripon.  During her family’s stay
					in Boroughbridge, three more siblings of Sarah Ann were born into the family; Phillis in 1835,
					Martin in 1837 and Johanna in 1841.  By 1851, the Allinson family had moved to Mickley, a village
					about three miles south-east of Masham.  By then, Sarah Ann was a servant in the home of Thomas
					and Charlotte Harrison at Artlington House in the township of Scriven, just north of Knaresborough.</p>
					<p>After Christopher had left for the big city, Sarah Ann soon realized that she was missing
					Christopher, and wished that she had gone down to Dewsbury with him.  By October, Sarah Ann realized
					that she was pregnant.  She confided in her parents, who knew that it was important to deal with the
					situation as quickly as possible.  They contacted Christopher and insisted that he do the right thing,
					and then made arrangements for their wedding in Dallowgill where Sarah Ann was born.  As a result,
					Christopher Imeson and Sarah Ann Allinson were married December 14, 1855 at St. Peter’s Chapel in
					Dallowgill.  Christopher and Sarah Ann Imeson very quickly took up residence on Peel Street in Batley Carr.</p>
					<p>Initially, Christopher’s occupation was as a labourer, but he was soon able to improve their
					situation with his new occupation as a carter with Joshua Ellis, a Woolen Manufacturer located
					in Batley Carr.  Sarah Ann soon started to show her pregnancy, and wondered why she was gaining
					weight and size so quickly.  She would find out soon enough.</p>
					<p>On May 14, 1856, she was ready to give birth to her first child at her home on Peel Street.
					At 12:30 noon, she gave birth to a daughter.  But she soon realized that she wasn’t finished yet,
					as she gave birth to her second child, a son, at 12:35 noon.  She was initially quite relieved
					that everything had gone so well, until she noticed that her son was having difficulty.  Before
					they could do anything for him, he died after 40 minutes of debility from birth.  Sarah Ann was
					devastated by the death of her son, but she knew that she had to carry on and look after her
					new baby daughter.  They named their daughter Elizabeth after her grandmother.  As was the
					usual practice back then, Christopher transported the body of their son that afternoon to All
					Saints Churchyard in Dewsbury for burial in the grave of an adult who was being buried that day.
					On his way home, Christopher stopped at the Dewsbury Registrar’s Office to register the birth of
					his daughter Elizabeth, as well as the birth and death of their unnamed son.</p>
					<table class="image" align="left" cellpadding="8"><tr><td align="center"><a href="images/Dewsbury_All_Saints_Parish_Church.jpg" target="_blank">
					<img src="images/Dewsbury_All_Saints_Parish_Church_thumb.jpg" border="1"></a><br><font class="img">Dewsbury All Saints<br>Parish Church</font><br></td></tr></table>
					<p>About a week after the birth of their daughter, Sarah Ann noticed that Elizabeth was not
					well; she seemed to be losing weight instead of gaining.  By the time that Elizabeth was
					nine weeks old, she had wasted away.  Elizabeth died of her condition on July 17, 1856.
					Cause of death was certified as marasmus.  Her death was registered on July 18, 1856 at the
					Dewsbury Registrar’s Office by Christopher Imeson.  Her burial would have to wait a couple
					of more days, until an adult burial was scheduled.  Where the parents could not afford a
					gravesite for an infant, the custom in those days was to include them in the grave of an adult
					just being buried.  She was buried July 20, 1856 at All Saints Churchyard in Dewsbury.</p>
					<p>Sarah Ann spent the next few months trying to deal with the sorrow she was feeling.  Not only
					had her son died at birth, but now her daughter had essentially starved to death.  With time,
					Sarah Ann’s mental condition improved, but she would never forget what had happened to her two
					babies.</p>
					<p>By the spring of 1857, the Imeson family had moved to a nearby house on Victoria Road.  By then,
					Sarah Ann was feeling better, and she realized that she was again pregnant.  She vowed that this
					time her baby would have a better fate.  The summer went by, and as her pregnancy developed, she
					looked forward to having a baby to look after.  On October 18, 1857 she gave birth to a baby boy,
					but because he had been born prematurely he only lived two hours.  His cause of death was certified
					as debility from premature birth.  The next day, this unnamed baby boy was buried at All Saints
					Churchyard in Dewsbury.  His birth and death were registered at the Dewsbury Registrar’s Office by
					Christopher Imeson on October 19, 1857.</p>
					<p>Again, Sarah Ann was devastated.  Now she had given birth and buried three children.  She vowed,
					never again.  She blamed herself, even though her husband Christopher told her that it wasn’t
					her fault.  It would be more than a year before she would become pregnant again.  Early in 1859,
					Sarah Ann realized that she was going to have another child.  Even though she wasn’t over the
					death of her first three children, she thought that this new pregnancy would be different, so
					she focused her attention on the coming birth.
					<p>In early September 1859, Sarah Ann gave birth to a son.  They named him Robert Wright after
					Christopher’s parents.  But very soon after his birth, Robert became sick.  Sarah Ann looked
					after him the best she could, as medical assistance was not readily available to the poor in
					those days.  His condition continued to deteriorate, and after eight weeks in his short life
					he died at home on October 31, 1859, despite his mother’s help.  The cause of his death was
					certified as marasmus and diarrhea.  Robert Wright’s death was registered at the Dewsbury
					Registrar’s Office on November 2, 1859 by Sarah Ann Imeson.  Robert Wright was buried at All
					Saints Churchyard on November 3, 1859, similar to his siblings before.</p>
					<table class="image" align="left" cellpadding="8"><tr><td align="center"><a href="images/Dewsbury_County_Cemetery_Layout.jpg" target="_blank">

					<p>Sarah Ann had difficulty coming to grips with the death of her son.  She blamed herself,
					but she couldn’t figure out what she should be doing differently.  Her depression lasted for
					several months before she started to feel somewhat better.  She just couldn’t forget what had
					happened to her four children.</p>
					<p>Sarah Ann was pleased when her sister Phillis decided to come stay with them soon after Robert
					Wright’s death.  Soon after her arrival, Phillis decided that she wanted to stay, but she would
					need to find a job, as Christopher and Sarah Ann could not afford to keep her.  Christopher was
					able to make arrangements with his employer, for Phillis to work as a servant at Highfield House
					at Batley Carr Top for Joshua Ellis, the Woolen Manufacturer.  Phillis continued to work there
					until her marriage in 1864, when she moved to Leeds.</p>
					<p>In the late spring of 1861, Sarah Ann realized that she was pregnant again.  On one hand she
					was looking forward to the birth of her child, but she also had visions of her dying children.
					Sarah Ann’s baby was finally born in November 1861 at her home on Victoria Road.  They named him
					Christopher Wright after his father and his grandmother.  For the first few weeks after his birth,
					things seemed to be going rather well for Sarah Ann’s baby.  She thought to herself that this
					time everything would be different.  Her baby was not premature and didn’t show signs of wasting
					away like some of her earlier children.  It didn’t take long until her baby was showing problems
					with breathing.  At four months of age, Christopher Wright died of pneumonia on March 6, 1862.
					His death was registered the same day by his father, who was home when Christopher died.
					Christopher Wright was buried two days later at the Dewsbury Cemetery.  His parents were able
					to make arrangements for a private grave plot K229, which was necessary because Dewsbury
					Churchyard was nearly full, and Dewsbury Cemetery had recently opened back in 1860.</p>
					<table class="image" align="left" cellpadding="8"><tr><td align="center"><a href="images/Highfield_House_Batley_Carr_Top.jpg" target="_blank">

					<p>Sarah Ann was again devastated by this latest death.  Just thinking about this death and
					the previous deaths made her sick.  She just didn’t know why this was happening to her.  How
					could five children in one family die as infants?  Surely, it must be her fault.  Her depression
					lasted several months.  She decided that she wouldn’t get pregnant again, as she couldn’t go
					through this again.  However, by the autumn of 1862, she realized that she was pregnant for the
					fifth time.  She didn’t want to go ahead with the pregnancy but she didn’t know that there was
					any other option.</p>
					<p>By the early spring of 1863, Sarah Ann was feeling better, and her pregnancy was in its
					final stages without complications.   In mid-March she gave birth to her sixth child, a girl
					they named Ada Maria.  For the first week or two, Ada Maria seemed to be doing quite well,
					but this soon changed as she began having difficulties.  Sarah Ann was not able to nurse
					Ada Maria back to health; she died April 19, 1863 at her home on Victoria Road.  The cause
					of death was certified as diarrhea and exhaustion.  Christopher Imeson was present at her
					death and the next day registered her death at the Dewsbury Registrar’s Office.  Ada Maria
					was buried April 21, 1863 in plot K229 at the Dewsbury Cemetery, just like her brother had
					been a year earlier.</p>
					<table class="image" align="left" cellpadding="8"><tr><td align="center"><a href="images/Dewsbury_County_Cemetery_Section_K.jpg" target="_blank">
					<img src="images/Dewsbury_County_Cemetery_Section_K_thumb.jpg" border="1"></a><br><font class="img">Dewsbury County Cemetery<br>Section K</font><br></td></tr></table>
					<p>Each time that an infant of Sarah Ann died, she was devastated.  Ada Maria’s death was
					no exception.  In those days, it wasn’t that uncommon for an infant to die, but having six
					infants from one family die was very unusual.  Sarah Ann never did get used to her children
					dying.  In order to help herself deal with these infant deaths, she knew that she had to find
					some way that would commemorate these children’s deaths, so they wouldn’t ever be forgotten.</p>
					<p>By the summer of 1863, she knew what she was going to do.  She had learned how to long-stitch
					as a child from her mother, and she decided that she would make a tapestry.  She knew that she
					had to recognize all six children who had died, so she needed a relatively large piece of
					cloth to work with.  Her experience with long-stitch so far was with handkerchiefs, so she
					had to locate wool that was suitable for a tapestry.  Sarah Ann located the wool, and spent
					the fall and winter working on her tapestry design.  She started by working on the border and
					the background images.  She left room for the names, ages and date of death of her six children,
					as well as verses that she wanted to include.</p>
					<p>By the spring of 1864, she realized that she was once again pregnant, so she decided to put
					her project on hold pending the birth of her seventh child.  In November 1864, Sarah Ann gave
					birth to her daughter, who they named Annie after her mother.  During the next winter and spring,
					Sarah Ann continued to work on the tapestry when she had time, as her new baby kept her busy.
					Everything was going well, until Annie developed a cold, and then later began having difficulty
					breathing and had a barking cough.  Her condition continued to deteriorate, to the point where
					she couldn’t breathe at all.  Annie died on November 26, 1865 at her home on Victoria Road
					at age one year.  The cause of her death was certified as croup, probably caused by a virus.
					Her death was registered by Christopher Imeson, who was present at her death, on November 27, 1865
					at the Dewsbury Registrar’s Office.  She was buried two days later in grave plot K229 at the
					Dewsbury Cemetery.</p>
					<table class="image" align="left" cellpadding="8"><tr><td align="center"><a href="images/Dewsbury_County_Cemetery_Plot_K229.jpg" target="_blank">

					<p>Once again Sarah Ann was devastated by her daughter’s death.  She went over and over in her
					mind that she had given birth to seven children and all of them had died as infants.  She knew
					that she had to complete the tapesrty, so she worked at including the information about her
					seven who had died, as well as the verse that meant so much to her.  By the spring of 1866,
					she realized that she was once again pregnant, but she decided she would finish the tapestry
					well before the birth of her child.  So in the fall of 1866, she put the finishing touches
					on the tapestry. She identified who had created it, and when. She then put it aside, focusing
					her attention on the impending birth of her eighth child.</p>
					<p>Sarah Ann gave birth to a baby girl in November 1866.  They named her Clara.  Everything
					seemed to be going quite well, so Sarah Ann began to feel better.  Clara’s development appeared
					normal, and after she had her first birthday, Sarah Ann was relieved, because all of her
					deceased children had died within a few weeks or months, and only Annie had celebrated her
					first birthday.</p>
					<p>By the fall of 1868, Sarah Ann realized that she was pregnant once again.  She didn’t now
					have any concerns, because Clara was nearly two years old, and she felt that the pattern had
					been broken.  In the spring of 1869, Sarah Ann gave birth to a healthy baby boy.  They named
					him Arthur.  Now Sarah Ann had two children who were both healthy.  As time went on, everything
					 was normal for those days.</p>
					<p>Late in the summer of 1871, Clara became sick.  Sarah Ann thought, “Not again!”  She
					attempted to nurse Clara back to health, but her symptoms continued to get worse.  Clara
					died September 9, 1871 of her sickness at home on Victoria Road.  The cause of death was
					certified as remittent fever and diarrhea.  Christopher registered her death that day at
					the Dewsbury Registrar’s Office, as he was present at her death.  Clara was buried two days
					later again in plot K229 at Dewsbury Cemetery.</p>
					<p>Sarah’s parents had continued to live in Mickley, North Yorkshire, which is about four
					miles from Dallowgill.  When her father John Allinson died in early 1871, Sarah Ann's mother
					Phillis decided to move down to Dewsbury to live with Sarah Ann and Christopher around 1872.
					Sarah Ann's mother was able to help her look after Arthur who was about three years old.</p>
					<p>Soon after Clara’s death, Sarah Ann realized that she was pregnant again.  She continued
					to look after Arthur, who was nearly three years old.  Sarah Ann gave birth to her tenth
					child, a baby boy, who they named Asa in May 1872.  Sarah Ann again had two children to look
					after, but it wasn’t very long before Asa was having difficulties.  He had complications with
					his teething, which resulted in his death on December 2, 1872 at his home on Victoria Road.
					The cause of death was certified dentition convulsions. His death was registered by his father,
					who was present at his death, on the next day at the Dewsbury Registrar’s Office.  Asa was
					buried on December 5, 1872 in plot K229 at the Dewsbury Cemetery.</p>
					<table class="image" align="left" cellpadding="8"><tr><td align="center"><a href="images/Batley_Cemetery_Layout.jpg" target="_blank">

					<p>Sarah Ann was distraught by Asa’s death.  In just over a year, two of her children had
					died, and now she had a total of nine children who had died as infants or as young children
					and only one had been spared.  She decided that it was important to her to add the names of
					these two latest children on the tapestry.  She had a look at the tapestry to see whether
					there was room for these additional names, as she remembered that she had it nicely spaced
					out.  There wasn’t very much room, but she had to add these names.  She wanted to keep the
					letters the same size for all children, so she found a way to add the names and use
					abbreviations whenever possible.  There was just enough room, so she completed the addition.
					This made her feel better.</p>

					<p>It wasn’t very long before she had other things to help take her mind off her deceased
					children.  By the spring of 1873, she was pregnant again, for the tenth time.  In the fall
					of 1873, Sarah Ann gave birth to her daughter, who they named Amy.  Sarah now had two
					children, Arthur was four and a half years old, and Amy was just a baby.</p>
					<p>Over the next five years, Phillis continued to live with Sarah Ann on Victoria Road in
					Batley Carr. She was able to help Sarah Ann change her luck, as both of Sarah Ann’s children
					were doing well.  At age 73, Sarah Ann’s mother died was buried August 4, 1877 at plot K229
					at Dewsbury Cemetery.</p>
					<p>Over the next six years, the Imeson Family lived on Victoria Road, Dewsbury.  Both children
					grew and developed normally.  When Christopher was only 55 years of age, he had a stroke and
					died February 14, 1885 at home on Victoria Road.  The cause of death was certified as apoplexy.
					His death was registered by his wife, who was present at his death, two days later.  He was
					buried on February 17, 1885 at plot K229 at Dewsbury Cemetery.

					<p>When Christopher died, the family had lived at 61 Victoria Road in Batley Carr.  After his
					death, Sarah Ann had difficulties continuing to live at their longtime house.  She had many
					memories, some of them positive, but many of the memories were of deaths that had occurred at
					her home over the years.  After Christopher’s death, she couldn’t continue to live there, so
					when there was an opportunity, she moved to 25 Victoria Street.</p>
					<p>After they moved, Arthur met Elizabeth Ann Coldwell who lived across the street on Victoria
					Street.  Elizabeth Ann was born in Batley Carr on King Street in early 1869.  Her parents were
					Joseph and Jane Coldwell.  Her siblings were Mary Ann, Arthur, Miranda, Drucilla, Eva, Frank
					and Fred.  By 1881, the Coldwell family had moved to 30 Victoria Street in Batley Carr.</p>
					<p>Arthur and Elizabeth Ann developed a relationship, but when Elizabeth realized that she
					was pregnant in the fall of 1889, Arthur agreed that they should get married, which occurred
					early in 1890 in Dewsbury.  Sarah Ann was disappointed that Christopher was not able to attend
					his son’s wedding, but she and Amy were there to represent the family.  Arthur and Elizabeth
					established their home at 27 Back Barber Street in Dewsbury.  Arthur continued to work as a
					beamer at the local woolen mill.</p>

					<p>Elizabeth gave birth to a baby boy in the spring of 1890, who they named Harry.  By the
					early 1891, Harry was sick and he died at age nine months.  Harry was buried in the Consecrated
					Section of Batley County Cemetery in grave H701.  He was buried on the February 15, 1891.

					they named Elsie.  By the autumn of 1897, Elsie became sick and died at age one year.
					Elsie is buried January 2, 1898 at the Dewsbury Cemetery plot K229. Arthur supported his
					wife because he knew the effect this had had on his own mother.</p>
					<p>By the winter of 1896/97, Sarah Ann’s health had declined, and her children were concerned
					about her making it through the winter.  She was able to last a few months, but on April 28, 1897,
					Sarah Ann died at 54 Carlton Road, which was at that time the Dewsbury Infirmary.  The cause
					of her death was certified as senile decay and cardiac failure.  Her death was registered
					the same day by Arthur, her son, at the Dewsbury Registrar’s Office.  Sarah Ann was buried

					<p>When Arthur was looking after Sarah Ann’s affairs, he came across the tapestry which he
					had forgotten about over the years.  He decided as the oldest son, that he should take
					ownership and control of the tapestry.  Even though it had been nearly 25 years since he
					had seen it, he remembered his mother explaining why she had created it.  While the tapestry
					had not been specifically cared for over the years, it still was in very good condition.  He
					knew that he had to take it home and look after it.</p>
					<p>After her mother’s death, Amy moved to live with her brother Arthur and his wife Elizabeth.
					Amy had worked as a weaver at a local woolen mill since she was a teenager.  She continued to
					live with her brother, when they moved to 7 Willan’s Road in Dewsbury.  By the summer of
					1900, Elizabeth realized that she was pregnant again.  She was concerned about this pregnancy
					because she didn’t want to repeat her previous experience.  In February 1901, Elizabeth Ann
					gave birth to her son, who they named Wilfred.</p>
					<p>At this time, Amy was preparing to marry James Hillery, whom she had met the previous year.
					James Hillery was born in the Guisborough area in the summer of 1875, and had moved to Dewsbury
					as an adult.  James’ parents were George and Bessy Hillery.  James’ siblings were George,
					Elizabeth, Thomas and Margaret.  Amy and James married in the Trinity Church in Batley Carr

					<p>In the spring of 1904, Elizabeth Ann discovered that she was pregnant again.  The pregnancy
					went well over the summer and she gave birth to a baby girl in the autumn of 1904 in Dewsbury.

					<p>The Imeson family moved to 10 Upper Road in Batley Carr.  In the spring of 1906, Elizabeth
					realized that she was pregnant once again.  Elizabeth gave birth to a baby boy, on October 16, 1906
					at her home in Batley Carr.  They named him Alec.</p>
					<p>All three of Arthur and Elizabeth Ann’s children grew up to adulthood without serious
					health problems.  In early 1928, their daughter Dorothy Imeson married Arthur Dickinson
					in Dewsbury.  His family was from the Dewsbury area.  Dorothy and her husband Arthur apparently
					had no children.</p>

					December 19, 1934 in Dewsbury.  Amy was buried December 22, 1934 in plot A624 at Dewsbury Cemetery.</p>
					<p>Arthur’s youngest son Alec Imeson married Malvina May Coulson in the spring of 1935 in
					Bristol.  Malvina was born January 5, 1911 in Bristol.</p>
					<p>At this time, Arthur and Elizabeth Imeson lived on Mill Road in Batley Carr.  On October 24, 1935,
					Arthur committed suicide in the mill dam where he was a foreman.  The inquest concluded that he had
					committed suicide while in a fit of depression owing to ill-health.  Arthur was buried on

					<p>After her husband’s death, Elizabeth decided to move to the Bristol area, in order to be
					closer to her youngest son Alec and his new wife.  During the move, Elizabeth Ann had come
					across the tapestry, and had decided that she should pass it on to her son.  Its condition had
					deteriorated over the years since his father had taken possession of it.  Elizabeth Ann had to
					explain the significance of the tapestry, because Alec hadn’t remembered ever having seen
					it over the years.  Alec accepted the tapestry, but decided to put it away in a drawer until he
					had time to look at it in detail.  Elizabeth Imeson died early in 1947 at age 78 in Clevedon, Somerset.</p>
					<p>Alec and Malvina May continued to live in the Bristol area.  They decided that they didn’t want
					children, and as a result, they didn’t have any.  Alec Imeson died in the autumn of 1964.
					His death was registered in Bristol.  Malvina May Imeson died in the spring of 1976.  Her death
					was registered in Bristol.</p>
