					<p>The Imeson Tapestry is a historical record of the family’s sorrow surrounding the death of their
						nine children over a sixteen year period.  One would think that these deaths must have been
						connected in some way.</p>
					<p>What are the odds that nine of eleven children in one family would die as infants or young
						children.  It is true that it wasn’t that unusual during the nineteenth century  for young
						children to die.  But it would have been quite unusual for this number of deaths to occur in
						one family.</p>
					<p>The initial thinking was that the family’s environment was the likely commonality between the
						deaths of these nine children.  The Dewsbury Reporter reported that in 1854:
						<li>the first reservoir at Dunford Bridge had just been completed.  There had been smaller
							reservoirs in Staincliffe and Bootheroyd Lane;</li>
						<li>the Board of Health had just been established;</li>
						<li>there were plans for a Burial Board to provide a new graveyard;</li>
						<li>there was no sewage works or sewage disposal plant;</li>
						<li>there was no gas undertaking;</li>
						<li>there was no electricity undertaking;</li>
						<li>there were no public baths;</li>
						<li>there was no library;</li>
						<li>there were no parks;</li>
						<li>there was no hospital;</li>
						<li>there was no town hall;</li>
						<li>there were no paved streets in the town;</li>
						<li>plate glass windows were a rarity.</li>
					<p>It would appear that Galactosemia was the reason that several of Sarah Ann's children died
						as infants or young children.  The symptoms of this condition are consistent with the cause
						of death for these children.  Since it is still in the family and genetic in nature, it is
						likely that both Christopher and Sarah Ann were carriers, and some of their children suffered
						from the condition.</p>
					<p>From what we understand about this defect, children who end up with it have parents who both
						are carriers.  If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% probability that the child will
						have the defect.  In addition, there is a 50% probability that the child will be a carrier.
						That leaves only a 25% probability that the child will not have the defect or be a carrier.
						As well, 75% of babies that have the condition and are not treated will die.</p>
					<p>It would appear that Galactosemia has been a genetic condition in the family for many
						generations.  Since this condition is inherited and runs in families, there is a high
						probability that some or all of Sarah Ann's children died as a result of this condition.
						Arthur Imeson was probably a carrier since he did not inherit the defect, and as a result
						would have had a 66.7% chance that he would become a carrier.  Also, it is likely that
						Elizabeth Ann was a carrier, and her first two children may have died as a result of this
						condition.</p>
					<p>It would appear that Christopher Imeson and Sarah Ann Allinson were both carriers.
						The symptoms of this disease are consistent with what many of Sarah Ann's children
						experienced.  The doctors back then didn't know about this genetic condition, and
						as a result the death certificates did not show it as a cause of death.	  They had
						no idea what was causing the problem, and what to do about it.</p>
					<p>We had a look at the cause of death and the age of Sarah Ann's nine children who are
						listed on the Tapestry, to see which of these children likely died as a result of Galactosemia.
						While it is possible that all of them died as a result of Galactosemia, the odds would suggest
						that it is unlikely.  Six of them would likely be candidates for this disorder; Male 1856,
						Elizabeth, Male 1857, Robert Wright, Ada Maria and Asa.
					<p>Christopher Wright died of Pneumonia, Annie died of Croup from a virus, and Clara was nearly
						five years old when she died of Remittent Fever and Diarrhea.  These three are not likely
						candidates for this disorder because their causes of death are not identified as a symptom
						of Galactosemia.  Six out of nine is a higher proportion than one would have expected.</p>
					<p>Were Christopher and Sarah Ann responsible for the death of the tapestry children?
						The answer is probably yes and no for six of them.  Since Galactosemia is an inherited
						disorder, their children received this disorder from both of their parents.  However,
						there wasn’t anything that Christopher and Sarah Ann could have done to prevent their
						deaths.  This disorder was not discovered until 1917, and its cause was only identified
						in 1956.  Not only did Christopher and Sarah Ann not know about this disorder, the medical
						community of the day had no idea that it existed.  One only has to look at the tapestry
						to understand what effect the deaths of her children had on her.  She loved her children,
						but didn’t know what she should do to prevent these infant deaths.</p>

					<p>According to answers.com, galactosemia is an inherited disease in which the transformation
						of galactose to glucose is blocked, allowing galactose to increase to toxic levels in the
						body.  If galactosemia is untreated, high levels of galactose cause vomiting, diarrhea,
						lethargy, low blood sugar, brain damage, jaundice, liver enlargement, cataracts,
						susceptibility to infection, and death.</p>
					<p>Galactosemia is a rare but potentially life-threatening disease that results from the
						inability to metabolize galactose. Serious consequences from galactosemia can be prevented
						by screening newborns at birth with a simple blood test.</p>
					<p>Galactosemia is an inborn error of metabolism.  "Metabolism" refers to all chemical reactions
						that take place in living organisms.  A metabolic pathway is a series of reactions where the product of each step in the series is the starting material for the next step.  Enzymes are the chemicals that help the reactions occur.  Their ability to function depends on their structure, and their structure is determined by the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence of the genes that encode them.  Inborn errors of metabolism are caused by mutations in these genes which do not allow the enzymes to function properly.</p>
					<p>Sugars are sometimes called "the energy molecules," and galactose and glucose are both sugars.
						For galactose to be utilized for energy, it must be transformed into something that can enter
						the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into energy (plus water and carbon dioxide).  This
						is important for infants because they typically get most of their nutrient energy from milk,
						which contains a high level of galactose. Each molecule of lactose, the major sugar
						constituent of milk, is made up of a molecule of galactose and a molecule of glucose,
						and so galactose makes up 20% of the energy source of a typical infant's diet.</p> 
					<p>Three enzymes are required to convert galactose into glucose-1-phosphate (a phosphorylated
						glucose that can enter the metabolic pathway that turns glucose into energy).  Each of these
						three enzymes is encoded by a separate gene.  If any of these enzymes fail to function, galactose
						build-up and galactosemia result.  Thus, there are three types of galactosemia with a different
						gene responsible for each.</p>
					<p>Every cell in a person's body has two copies of each gene.  Each of the forms of galactosemia
						is inherited as a recessive trait, which means that galactosemia is only present in individuals
						with two mutated copies of one of the three genes. This also means that carriers, with only one
						copy of a gene mutation, will not be aware that they are carrying a mutation (unless they have
						had a genetic test), as it is masked by the normal gene they also carry and they have no symptoms
						of the disease.  For each step in the conversion of galactose to glucose, if only one of the two
						copies of the gene controlling that step is normal (i.e. for carriers), enough functional enzyme
						is made so that the pathway is not blocked at that step.  If a person has galactosemia, both copies
						of the gene coding for one of the enzymes required to convert glucose to galactose are defective
						and the pathway becomes blocked.  If two carriers of the same defective gene have children, the
						chance of any of their children getting galactosemia (the chance of a child getting two copies
						of the defective gene) is 25% (one in four) for each pregnancy.</p>
					<p>It would appear that Galactosemia was the reason that several of Sarah Ann's children died
						as infants or young children.  The symptoms of this condition are consistent with the cause
						of death for these children.  Since it is still in the family and genetic in nature, it is
						likely that both Christopher and Sarah Ann were carriers, and some of their children suffered
						from the condition.</p>
