						Saskatoon, a commercial and educational centre in the province of Saskatchewan, is
						situated on the banks of the South Saskatchewan River in Townships 36 and 37, Range
						5 and Township 36, Range 6, West of Third Meridian.  In 1890 the Qu’Appelle, Long Lake
						and Saskatchewan Railway Company bridged the river at Saskatoon and built a line to
						Prince Albert.  A new settlement soon developed on the west side of the river around
						the railway station.  In 1901, the present-day downtown area (on the west side of the
						river) was incorporated as a village and kept the name of Saskatoon.  A third
						settlement, Riversdale, developed west of the railway tracks.  The name of the original
						settlement on the east side changed to Nutana.  In 1903 it became a town and in 1906
						with the promise of a traffic bridge and other civic improvements, the three settlements
						amalgamated to form a city.  Following the formation of the Province of Saskatchewan
						on September 1, 1905, the premier focused on the creation of a provincial university
						and agricultural college, which was approved for Saskatoon in 1907.

						The trickle of immigrants was becoming a flood and Saskatoon became the fastest growing
						city in Canada.  Saskatoon became the central city of central Saskatchewan because a
						small group of pioneer businessmen tirelessly lobbied to make sure the railways came to
						their town.  By 1908 three railway bridges and a traffic bridge crossed the South
						Saskatchewan and Saskatoon was the hub of a transportation network.  The first real
						boom was during the period 1906-08.  A second, even more vigorous boom period was from
						1910 to 1913.  By 1911, the population had more than doubled and Saskatoon had become
						a major distribution centre for the surrounding agricultural district.
