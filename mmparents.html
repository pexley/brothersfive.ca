						Perry’s father died prematurely on January 2, 1878 of an inflammation of his bowels,

						Around the turn of the century, Perry and Ellen Leach and their four children moved to
						the City of Hamilton from Waterford, Ontario to pursue economic improvements.  They
						lived on the outskirts of town north of the downtown area.  Perry was not very busy
						with his blacksmith business, so Perry had to do odd jobs to help make ends meet.
					</P>
					<P>
						Over the next few years, economic conditions did not improve for the Leach family.  On
						July 7, 1902, their fifth child Zina Leach was born putting more pressure on their
						financial circumstance.  As a result, Perry knew that he had to do something to improve
						the situation.  He had heard about the annual thresher man’s excursions in far away
						Northwest Territories, and wondered if this would be a possible solution to his problems.
						He remembered his experience working on his father’s farm before his father’s death,
						and thought that farm work looked pretty good.
