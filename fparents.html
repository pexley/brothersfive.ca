						Sam Exley was born April 4, 1885 in Earlsheaton, Yorkshire, a village east of Dewsbury.
						His father, Scott Exley was born March 30, 1854 in Earlsheaton.  His mother, Ann Exley
						was born November 28, 1856 also in Earlsheaton.  Scott and Ann were married close to
						eight years before Sam was born.  When Sam was only four years old, his father drowned
						in Little Royd Mill Dam on August 25, 1889 in Earlsheaton.  Sam’s father was only 35
						years old when he died.  At the inquest held at the Spangled Bull Inn in Earlsheaton,
						the jury’s verdict was that he had committed suicide “whilst of unsound mind”.  As a
						result, Sam was an only child.

						By 1891, Sam and his mother still lived in Earlsheaton on Church Hill in Kirk House.

						Watson and Ann Exley married December 8, 1894 at St Mark’s Church in Dewsbury,
						Yorkshire.  The family moved to Thornhill Lees, a village just south of Dewsbury.
						By 1901, Edmund, Ann and their sons were living on 10 Lees Grove in Thornhill Lees.
						Sam Watson Exley was working for the Providence Bottle Works in Thornhill Lees as a
						fireman.  When Edmund, Ann and Charles William left for Canada in 1906, Sam moved to
						South Elmwood Street in Dewsbury.  While living in Thornhill Lees, Sam had become
						friends with William Flowers who lived in the same neighbourhood as he did and also
						worked at Providence Bottle Works.  Sam had become interested in William Flower’s older
						sister Mary Emily Imeson.

						Yorkshire.  Her mother, Margaret Thomas was born May 1, 1860 in Derby, Derbyshire.
						Mary Emily’s older brother Philip was born on February 8, 1879.  She became fatherless
						soon after her birth when her father died November 5, 1881 in Earlsheaton of typhoid
						fever.

					<p>
						Mary Emily’s mother was a widow with two children at age 21.  About a year later, Mary
						Emily’s mother began a relationship with widower Charles Flowers, who was a blacksmith
						from the Thornhill area.  They married January 12, 1884, setting up house on New Street
						in Earlsheaton, and in 1887 moved to Walker Street in Thornhill Lees.  Charles and
						Margaret Flowers had four children, George (1885), William (1889), Joseph (1891) and
						Lily (1893).  Mary Emily’s step-father died of heart disease February 1, 1896 in
						Thornhill Lees.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mary Emily’s mother and her family of six children continued to live on Ingham Road
						in a house that had been built by her step-father.  Mary Emily’s mother became good
						friends with William Carruthers, who worked at the Providence Bottle Works as a glass
						bottle blower.  After William’s wife died in early 1899, they began a relationship and
						married September 29, 1900 in Dewsbury.  Margaret and William had one child, Arthur

						By the later part of 1910, Margaret was receiving glowing reports from William and Mary
						Emily encouraging them to move to Canada as well.  So on December 9, 1910, Mary Emily’s
						mother Margaret sold her two houses located on Ingham Road, Thornhill Lees, and made
						arrangements to immigrate to Canada early in 1911.  Mary Emily’s step-father, William
						Carruthers was torn, as he hated to leave his own children behind, but he also wanted
						to stay with Margaret.  He eventually decided to stay, and move back with his children
						on Walker Street.  Mary Emily’s brother Philip and his wife Annie had also remained in
						England.

						Margaret’s health had deteriorated and she became very ill.  As a result, she was not
						well enough to continue on to Lumsden, Saskatchewan where Mary Emily and her family
						lived.  She was also too ill to return to England, so she stayed in Saint John until
						her health improved.  The family stayed in Saint John for more than six weeks while she
						recovered from her illness.  During the family’s stay in Saint John, Margaret decided
