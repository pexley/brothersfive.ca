						Our first stop was at Detroit Lakes, Becker County in Minnesota.  My gg-grandfather
						Buckley B. Anderson and his wife Sally and six of their children moved to Audubon
						Township in 1869. Buckley’s son-in-law Jackson Burdick and his family, as well as his
						mother-in-law Lois Cutler moved here with them.  Buckley had purchased 160 acres of
						Public Land in Sections 17 and 20 in Township 139-N Range 42-W which was eventually
						registered March 15th, 1876.   We visited the Historical Society where we obtained a
						recent plat map for Audubon Township, as well as cemetery records for the county.  We
						then visited the Becker County Recorder Office where we obtained copies of the following
						documents:
						<ol>
							<li>Mortgage that Buckley & Sally Anderson took out on their land with the New England Mortgage Security Company for a sum of $700.00 on August 28, 1875;</li>
							<li>Certificate of the Register of Detroit, Minnesota for the purchase of public lands dated March 15, 1876;</li>
							<li>Release of above mortgage dated 7 February 1877;</li>
							<li>Mortgage that Buckley & Sally Anderson took out with the New England Mortgage Security Company for a sum of $660.00 on 155 acres of their land on July 1, 1876;</li>
							<li>Warranty Deed where Buckley & Sally Anderson sold to the Oakwood Cemetery Association for the sum of $40.00 four acres of their land located in Section 17 on October 26, 1977;</li>
							<li>Release of above mortgage dated July 11, 1881;</li>
							<li>Indenture wherein Buckley & Sally Anderson sold for the sum of $300.00 plus $660.00 owing on the mortgage their 156 acres on April 21, 1881;</li>
							<li>Deed filed by Buckley Anderson, who was appointed Administrator of Lois Cutler’s estate on July 1, 1882, where he sold for the sum of $841.40 her 120 acres plus a lot located in Section 18 Township 139-N Range 41-W on July 19, 1882.</li>

					<p>
						We then visited Sections 17 & 20 in Audubon Township, Becker County where Buckley
						B Anderson and family lived until 1881.  We visited the Oakwood Cemetery and found the
						gravestone of my ggg-grandmother Lois Cutler who had died March 23, 1878 in Oak Lake,
						Minnesota.  We also visited the Audubon First Lutheran Cemetery looking for the grave
						of my ggg-grandmother Lydia Anderson who had died May 27, 1876.  We had information that
						her death had occurred in Audubon, Becker County.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our First stop on the next day was at the Mount Pleasant Cemetery close to Clitherall,
						Otter Tail County, Minnesota.  We found the gravestones for my three ancestors who were
						buried there, namely:
						<ol>
							<li>My ggg-grandmother Mary (Baker) Burdick, who died March 24th, 1872;</li>
							<li>My gg-grandfather Francis Lewis Whiting, who died April 10th, 1911;</li>
							<li>My gg-grandmother Ann Janette (Burdick) Whiting, who died January 21st, 1917.</li>
						</ol>

					<p>
						Our next stop was at Old Town Clitherall, where my grandfather Victor Rozelle Anderson
						was born July 16th, 1876.  His parents were Edwin Buckley Anderson and Emma Lucine
						(Whiting) Anderson, who were married here April 5th, 1870.  It appears that the original
						buildings no longer exist.  The exception is an old vacant building which looks like it
						could have been the village general store.  The LDS church looks in good shape, but
						doesn’t appear to be the original church, as it was built around 1911.  In 1884, my
						gg-grandfather Francis Lewis Whiting had a residence in Old Clitherall.  He also had
						a 160 acre homestead in the nearby township of Girard, which he finally gained title
						to March 24th, 1888.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our next stop was on the north side of East Battle Lake, where my g-grandfather Edwin
						Anderson had homesteaded 160 acres beginning in 1878, gaining title May 4th, 1885.
						Edwin’s homestead included about one half mile of lake front land, which is now heavily
						populated with cottages and homes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our last stop in Otter Tail County was further north in Girard Township where my
						gg-grandfather Buckley B Anderson homesteaded 160 acres in 1881, and gained title
						April 6th, 1888.  Buckley’s son Myron homesteaded 136 acres on the same Section at
						the same time.  All of Buckley’s living sons were farmers in Girard Township in 1884.

						After arriving in Nauvoo, we visited the
						<a href="http://www.historicnauvoo.net/site_view.cfm?Loc=vc&SiteID=6" target="_blank">
						Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints Visitors’ Centre</a> where we viewed a 20
						minute film "Remembering Nauvoo" which depicted the timeframe between 1839 and 1846 when
						Nauvoo was home to the Church.
					</p>
					<p>
						We later visited the site of the new
						<a href="http://www.historicnauvoo.net/temple.cfm" target="_blank">Nauvoo Temple</a>
						completed in 2002, which replaced the original Temple destroyed in 1848.  We were
						disappointed that we had missed the open house back in 2002, as the Temple is apparently
						no longer open to the public.  So we took our photos of the outside, and moved onto the
						Joseph and Hyrum Smith Memorial across from the Temple which depicts the brothers
						beginning the fateful journey from Nauvoo to Carthage to answer charges against them
						for causing a riot. Three days later, they were killed while awaiting trial in the
						Carthage Jail.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next day, we first re-visited the Visitors’ Center to view a 68 minute film "Joseph
						Smith, The Prophet of the Restoration", which depicted the life of Joseph Smith, Jr.

						We next visited the
						<a href="http://www.historicnauvoo.net/site_view.cfm?Loc=res&SiteID=28" target="_blank">
						Land and Records Office</a>, which has records on the locations of the homes and
						property of those who resided in Nauvoo from 1839 to 1846, including records on many of
						the early members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  So we enquired
						about some of my ancestors, which we searched for on their computer.  We found
						information files on two of my gg-grandparents as well as all of my Anderson
						ggg-grandparents, and some of their ancestors for a total of sixteen files.  All of
						these files were burned onto a CD-ROM for our later research.
					</p>
					<p>
						We then drove to Carthage, Illinois and visited the
						<a href="http://www.lds.org/placestovisit/location/0,10634,1844-1-1-1,00.html" target="_blank">
						Carthage Jail</a> and the Visitors’ Center where Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were killed

					<p>
						We then visited the <a href="http://www.hancockcoingov.org/recorder/" target="_blank">
						Hancock County Recorder Office</a> to research their records for my ancestors who
						resided in the county between 1839 and 1846.   All of the documents that we found
						related to land transactions involving Alpheus Cutler and sometimes his wife Lois
						Cutler.  These land transactions involve farmland located in Section 20 of Sonora
						Township and three lots in the City of Nauvoo:
						<ol>
							<li>On February 6th, 1841, Alpheus Cutler purchased for the sum of $400.00 an undivided half of NW quarter of Section 20 of Township 6 North of Range 8 West of the 4th Principle Median containing 160 acres;</li>

							<li>On September 17th, 1841, Alpheus Cutler sold for the sum of $200.00 the South half of NW quarter of Section 20 of Township 6 North of Range 8 West of the 4th Principle Median containing 80 acres;</li>
							<li>On July 31st, 1845, Alpheus Cutler purchased for $150.00 Lot Two in Block Three in Worthington’s addition to the City of Nauvoo containing just under one-third acre;</li>
							<li>On March 21st, 1846, Alpheus and Lois Cutler sold for $400.00 their remaining 60 acres on the east end of the North half of NW quarter of Section 20 of Township 6 North of Range 8 West of the 4th Principle Median;</li>

							<li>On September 17th, 1846, Alpheus and Lois Cutler sold for $175.00 the east part of lot four in block twenty-two of Kimball’s addition to Nauvoo containing one-fourth acre also lot two in block three in Worthington’s addition to the City of Nauvoo containing just less than one-third acre.</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					</p>
						We returned to Nauvoo and visited the <a href="http://www.historicnauvoo.net/jshs.cfm" target="_blank">
						Joseph Smith Historic Site</a>.  We then took a walk through the beautiful Monument to
						Women garden, honoring women of the past, present and future located adjacent to the
						Visitors’ Center.  To cap-off the day, we attended
						“<a href="http://www.historicnauvoo.net/cal_display.cfm?eventid=76DDF2DE-440F-40DC-A79F45056CF7973E&Type=2&mn=5&y=2007" target="_blank">

						The first part of the Mormon Trail crosses southern Iowa from Montrose (across the
						Mississippi River from Nauvoo) to Council Bluffs on the east side of the Missouri River
						across from Omaha.  As you travel the designated highways and roads, there are markers
						every so often that indicate that you are either traveling along the actual Mormon Trail
						or more often that the actual Mormon Trail crosses the highway.
					</p>
					<p>
						While there are several Pioneer Trail historical sites across Iowa, we decided to stop
						at the two semi-permanent camps that were built for the benefit of those who would
						follow as well as visiting the locations in western Iowa where my ancestor lived between
						1846 and 1864.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our first stop was at
						<a href="http://www.mormonhistoricsitesregistry.org/USA/iowa/decatur/gardenGrove/history.htm" target="_blank">
						Garden Grove Trailside Historic Site</a>, which is about a mile west of town.  There is
						a large marker which commemorates the Pioneers who spent time at Garden Grove as well as
						those who died there and are buried in that park.  The marker does not name any of those
						that died there, and I don’t believe that any of my ancestors actually died there.
						There are two wayside exhibits which describe the founding and development of the site.
						We walked along the trail as far as we could.  There are markers which show where some
						of the cabins were, as well as a graveyard.
					</p>
						<table class="image" align="left" cellpadding="8"><tr><td align="center"><a href="images/2007_mount_pisgah_monument.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/2007_mount_pisgah_monument.jpg" width="180" border="1"></a><br><font class="img">Mount Pisgah Monument<br>Deaths (1846-1848)</font><br></td></tr></table>
					<p>
						Later we stopped at
						<a href="http://www.mormonhistoricsitesregistry.org/USA/iowa/union/mtPisgah/history.htm" target="_blank">
						Mount Pisgah Historic Site</a>.  There is a monument there which lists some of the
						Pioneers who died and were buried there.  After reviewing the names, I found two of my
						ancestors listed there.  Dates of death were not indicated, but presumably all of those
						listed were buried there before the camp was vacated in 1852.  The site also has a log
						cabin and a wayside exhibit.  Since the actual camp was much larger than the present
						site, we had made arrangements with the farmer who owns the land for a very interesting
						tour.  Using divining, he could show us exactly where the cabins and dugouts had been
						built.  In addition, he could show us the location of one of the graveyards as well as
						where the trail ruts were from the wagons.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since my great-grandmother had been born at Silver Creek, Iowa, we wanted to find its
						location.  A map of western Iowa showing the location of various camps suggested that
						Silver Creek was located in south-central Pottawattamie County about two or three miles
						north of Mills County.  We were able to find two of the legs of the actual creek, but
						did not find where they met.  We later found another map which showed the location of
						Silver Creek camp between the junction of the two legs of the creek and the county line.
						We were later reminded by my great-grandmother’s memoirs that she was actually born in
						Mills County, presumably just south of the county line.
					</p>
					<p>
						We visited <a href="http://www.co.fremont.ia.us/fremcorecd.htm" target="_blank">
						Fremont County Recorder Office</a> to research their records for my ancestors who
						resided in Manti, Fremont County between 1852 and 1865.  We found the following
						documents:

							<li>On September 17th, 1855, Alpheus and Lois Cutler sold to their son Thaddeus and another person for $100.00 the South half of SW quarter of Section 36 Township 69N of Range 40W containing 80 acres;</li>
							<li>On January 6th, 1857, Francis Lewis Whiting purchased for $10.00 one acre in the South-East corner of the NE quarter of the SE quarter of Section 35 Township 69N of Range 40W;</li>

							<li>On September 20th, 1864, Francis Lewis and Janette Whiting sold for $500.00 the West half of SW quarter of SE quarter and NW quarter of SE quarter of Section 35 Township 69N of Range 40W containing 60 acres;</li>
							<li>On September 27th, 1864, Francis L and Ann Janette Whiting sold for $100.00 one acre in the South-East corner of the NE quarter of the SE quarter of Section 35 Township 69N of Range 40W.</li>
						</ol>
					<p>
						We next visited Fisher Township to find the location of Manti, Iowa.  Once we found
						Manti Road, we traveled east until the road turned north, where we found Manti Park and
						Cemetery.  While none of the original buildings still exist, there was a sign that
						indicated the location of the Manti School 1853-1946.  We walked through the park about
						a mile to the Manti Cemetery, where we found several gravestones.  One of the
						gravestones was that of Alpheus Cutler, my ggg-grandfather who had died there August
						10th, 1864.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, we visited the
						<a href="http://www.lds.org/placestovisit/location/0,10634,1809-1-1-1,00.html" target="_blank">
						Kanesville Tabernacle</a> in Council Bluffs, which is a replica of the log tabernacle

					<p>
						We next visited the Caldwell County Recorder Office.  We enquired about County documents
						from the 1830s, but were informed that all the documents from that period were destroyed
						in a fire in the 1850s.  We asked about old maps, but all that was found was an old plat
						book.  We had a look at the plat for Mirabel Township 56N Range 29W of the 5th Prime
						Meridian.  We obtained a copy as many of the dates shown were from the 1830s, including
						a date of June 22, 1836 for Joseph Smith Jr.

						the half mile distance to locate the few homes which is Lebeck today.  We found the
						cemetery, and looked for gravestones for my gg-grandparents Buckley B and Sally M
						Anderson, which we didn’t find there.  We still think that they were likely buried
						there without gravestones.
					</p>
					<p>
						We next visited the Cedar County Recorder Office.  We had previously obtained a copy
						of two documents relating to farmland owned by Edwin B Anderson near Lebeck.  We found
						two additional documents as follows:
						<ol>
							<li>On March 19th, 1889, Buckley B Anderson purchased for $250.00 Lots
							3, 4, 8, 9 and 10 in block one in the town of Lebeck;</li>
							<li>On January 20th, 1892, Buckley B Anderson sold to his son Myron M Anderson
							for $200.00 Lots 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10 in block one in the town of Lebeck.</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p>
						We retuned to Lebeck and found the location of Edwin B Anderson’s 40 acre farmland
						at the SW quarter of SW quarter of Section 16 of Township 36N of Range 27W.

						We headed west from Council Bluffs, but first we visited the Mormon Trail Center in
						historic Winter Quarters at Florence, Nebraska.  It has a large museum with interpretive
						exhibits on the history of the entire trail.  Across the street, is the Winter Quarters
						Cemetery Historic Site where many of the Mormons who died between 1846 and 1852 are
						buried.

						The route west generally follows the Platte River upstream to the North Platte River
						and then the Sweetwater River through Nebraska and Wyoming.  For most of the way, it
						follows the same route as was taken by other pioneer groups.  As we headed west, we
						frequently noticed road signs that related to the Oregon Trail (1836-1869), the
						California Trail (1841-1869), as well as the Pony Express Trail (1860-1861).  We
						specifically followed the Mormon Trail road signs all the way to Salt Lake City.  We
						stopped at most of the frequent markers along the way and took photographs of those
						relating to the Mormon Trail.

					<p>
						Our first stop was at
						<a href="http://www.ci.genoa.ne.us/history.asp" target="_blank">
						Genoa, Nebraska</a> which was established as a temporary settlement in 1857 by the
						Mormons as a way station for the mail and a rest and supply stop for the Mormons
						traveling to the Utah territory.  Genoa was abandoned by the Mormons in 1859 when it
						became part of an Indian Reservation.

						We stopped at
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayres_Natural_Bridge" target="_blank">
						Ayres Natural Bridge Park</a> in Wyoming, which is a natural bridge with water running

					</p>
					<p>
						We visited the
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Caspar" target="_blank">
						Mormon Ferry Site</a> in Casper, Wyoming located at the rebuilt old Fort Casper.
						Established in 1847, this was the first commercial ferry on the North Platte River.

					</p>
					<p>
						We next stopped at the Echo Canyon Historic Marker.  The
						<a href="http://history.utah.gov/apps/markers/detailed_results.php?markerid=3056" target="_blank">
						Echo Canyon Breastworks</a> were constructed at the time of the Utah War (1857-1858)
						high up on the north wall at the narrowest point of Echo Canyon as a defensive measure.
						However, these fortifications were not needed as the dispute was peacefully resolved.

						Our last stop before we arrived in Salt Lake City was at Big Mountain Historic Site.
						The Mormons went to Mormon Flat where they turned up Little Emigration Canyon.  Here
						they prepared for the 4.2 mile climb up Little Emigration Canyon, the longest sustained
						climb of the entire trail.  They reached Pratt's Pass on the shoulder of Big Mountain,
						the highest mountain crossed on their entire trip.
					</p>
					<p>
						We finally arrived in Salt Lake City.  Once we were settled, we visited the
						<a href="http://www.lds.org/placestovisit/location/0,10634,1869-1-1-1,00.html" target="_blank">
						Family History Library</a>, which was very interesting.  There were five floors of
						genealogical source documentation which included books, microfilm, maps, family history
						documents and computers.  The top two floors were for North America, the main floor
						was family books, with the 1st basement for non-English speaking ancestors, and the 2nd
						basement for English speaking ancestors.  We found the following documents of interest:
						<ol>
							<li>An entire book entitled “Alpheus Cutler (1784-1864)”;</li>
							<li>Map of the State of Missouri dated 1831;</li>
							<li>Map of “Zion’s Camp Trail, 1834 Missouri, Part 2”;</li>

						could hear a pin dropped at the pulpit clearly at the back of the hall.  We walked
						around Temple Square viewing the various memorials, as well as looking for the best
						angle to photograph the Temple.
					</p>
					<p>
						We attended the Mormon Tabernacle Choir rehearsal that evening at the
						<a href="http://www.lds.org/placestovisit/location/0,10634,1867-1-1-1,00.html" target="_blank">
						Conference Center</a>.  The auditorium was very impressive, and although the acoustics
						do not match those of The Tabernacle, we could clearly hear what the conductor was
						saying to the Orchestra and the Choir.  And of course, the music was wonderful.
