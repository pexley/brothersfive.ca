					<p>
						Buckley Burnham Anderson was born January 14, 1819 in Eldridge Township (now Berlin), Huron County (now Erie) in Ohio.
						Buckley’s twin brother Blakely B Anderson was born the same day.  Buckley’s parents were John Anderson and Lydia Kellogg.
						They had married the previous year on March 5, 1818 in Eldridge Township, Huron County, Ohio.

						Buckley’s father John Anderson was born on March 9, 1796 in Mansfield Township, Tolland County, Connecticut.  The Andersons
						had lived in Mansfield Township for several generations, back to John’s great-grandparents Robert and Abigail Anderson, who
						had arrived there back in 1722.
					</p>
					<p>
						Buckley’s mother Lydia (Kellogg) Anderson was born July 21, 1792 in Hebron, Tolland County, Connecticut.  Lydia’s grandparents
						Moses and Jerusha Kellogg had moved to Hebron from West Hartford, Connecticut.
					</p>
					<p>
						By 1810, the Anderson family was living in Willington Township whereas the Kellogg family was living in Tolland Township both
						in Tolland County, only a few miles apart.  Because of their respective locations, it is likely that John and Lydia knew each
						other.  So when Lydia’s parents decided to move the wilderness of Ohio likely as part of the Firelands settlement after the War
						of 1812 which ended in 1815, John left his parents and siblings behind and moved with the Kellogg family to Eldridge Township,
						Huron County, Ohio in 1816. The Firelands tract was land set aside from the Connecticut Western Reserve as compensation for 
						Connecticut residents who lost homes in the revolutionary war.
					</p>
					<p>
						All of Buckley’s siblings were born in Eldridge Township over the next fifteen years.  They were:
					</p>

						<li>Twin brother Blakely B born January 14, 1819;</li>

						For unknown reasons, several of Buckley’s siblings died as young children around 1830, while the family was living in Eldridge Township,
						Huron County.   Those children who died then were Celia, Brigham, Melissa, Amos, Elisha and Elijah.

						By October 1834, Buckley’s parents had become involved in the new religious movement headed by Joseph Smith II, which was making its
						headquarters and building a temple at Kirtland, Ohio.  Buckley’s father had hosted an appointment in Florence Township, which was just
						east of where the Andersons lived.  As well, Buckley’s father donated money to William McLellin, the missionary who introduced
						Buckley’s family to the Latter-Day Saints movement.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is not clear exactly when Buckley’s parents joined the LDS Church or if they moved to Kirtland to help build the temple.
						The family moved to Fishing River Township, Clay County, Missouri in September 1835 from Ohio.  The Missouri Mormons had
						begun to move across the Missouri River the year before because of past difficulties in Jackson County.  Buckley’s parents
						had obtained a 60 acre farm in Section 28 of Fishing River Township (identified as Township 52 North of Range 30 West of the
						5th Meridian), which Buckley’s parents sold to James Roberts on October 25, 1836 for the consideration of $220.00.
					</p>
					<p>
						By early 1837, the Missouri Mormons were moving north out of Clay County to the newly created Caldwell and Daviess Counties.
						Buckley’s parents moved in February 1837 to Mirabile Township, Caldwell County (identified as Township 52 North of Range 29
						West of the 5th Meridian) to a 40 acre parcel of public lands in Section 7, which they purchased later on August 2, 1838.

					<font class="hdr2">Sally Maria Cutler</font><br>
					<p>
						Sally Maria Cutler was born on September 9, 1818 in Bloomfield Township, Ontario County, New York.  Sally’s parents were
						Alpheus Cutler and Lois Lathrop.  Sally’s father was born on February 29, 1784 in Plainfield Township, Sullivan County, New
						Hampshire.  Sally’s mother was born on September 24, 1788 in Lebanon Township, Grafton County, New Hampshire.  Sally’s
						parents had married November 17, 1808 in Lebanon, Grafton, New Hampshire.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sally’s parents moved to Upper Lisle Township, Broome County, New York.  Sally was the fifth of eleven children, all born
						in New York State.  Sally’s siblings born in Lisle Township, Broome County were:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Brother Thaddeus Cutler born June 18, 1809;</li>
						<li>Sister Lois Huntington Cutler born March 2, 1811;</li>
						<li>Brother Libbeus Cutler born in 1814;</li>
						<li>Sister Louise Elizabeth Cutler born January 17, 1816.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						About 1817, Sally’s parents and her four older siblings moved from Lisle Township, Broome County to Bloomfield
						Township, Ontario County.  Sally’s brother Libbeus died in 1819 at 5 years of age, while the family lived in
						Bloomfield Township, Ontario County.  Sally’s brother William Lathrop Cutler was born February 6, 1821 in
						Bloomfield Township, Ontario County.
					</p>
					<p>
						About 1822, Sally’s family moved to Pomfret Township, Chautauqua County in the most westerly part of New York
						State.  Five of Sally’s siblings were born in Chautauqua County.  They were:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Brother Benjamin Franklin Cutler born April 13, 1823 in Pomfret Township;</li>
						<li>Sister Clarissa Crissy Cutler born December 23, 1824 in Pomfret Township;</li>

						<li>Brother Edmund H Cutler born in 1829 in Pomfret Township;</li>
						<li>Sister Betsey Ann Cutler born in 1832 in Pomfret Township.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Sally’s father purchased two parcels of land located in Hanover Township west of Hanover Center and south of Silver Creek
						in Chautauqua County from the Holland Land Company on August 12, 1828.

					<p>
						On January 20, 1833, Sally’s father was baptized into the Church of Latter-Day Saints Church and ordained as an Elder.
						Later that summer, construction of the Kirkland Temple began.  Sally’s parents moved to Kirtland, Ohio during
						the spring of 1834.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sally’s older sister Lois Huntington Cutler married Almon Worthy Sherman on May 14, 1835.  Sally’s sister Louisa
						Elizabeth Cutler married Tunis Rappleye on January 17, 1836.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sally’s father labored on the Kirtland Temple almost from the beginning and until the structure was finished.
					</p>
					<p>
						On March 27, 1836, The Kirkland Temple was dedicated at a ceremony attended by over 400 members of the Church
						of Latter-day Saints.  Sally’s family was no doubt present.  Sally’s father was ordained as a High Priest on
						April 29, 1836 in Kirkland before the family moved west to Missouri.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Cutler family, consisting of Alpheus and Lois and their children, Thaddeus and his family, daughter Lois
						and her husband, Almon Sherman, came from Kirtland and selected land in northern Ray County along the Crooked River.
					</p>
					<p>
						Anticipating a move to Far West, Caldwell County, on October 13, 1836 Sally’s parents made arrangements for a 40 acres
						of Public Lands located in Mirabile Township (identified as the NE ¼ of the NW ¼ in Township 56 North of Range 29 West
						of the 5th Prime Meridian).  Sally’s parents completed this purchase on September 7, 1838.

						Soon after their marriage, Buckley and Sally moved up to Caldwell County, which had been created out of Ray County
						in 1836 with the understanding that it would be dedicated to Mormon settlers, with its county seat in Far West.
						Buckley and Sally’s daughter Elvira A Anderson was born on September 28, 1838 at Far West, Caldwell.  At that very time,
						the Mormon War had begun on August 6, 1838 and continued on until November 1, 1838.  After the Battle of Crooked River
						on October 24, 1838, the militia was called out to prevent further violence.  On October 27, 1838, Missouri’s Governor
						issued Executive Order 44, an extermination order which stated that the Mormons must be treated as enemies and driven 
						from the State if necessary for the public peace.  After Haun’s Mill massacre, which occurred on October 30, 1838, and
						the siege of Far West by the Missouri militia, the Mormons agreed to evacuate the State by the next spring, thus
						fulfilling the Executive Order.  Missouri blamed the Mormons for the conflict, forcing the Mormons to sign over all
						their lands in order to pay for the state militia muster.
					</p> 
					<p>
						Buckley and his family moved from Far West to the Quincy area in Adams County, Illinois arriving in March 1839 with more
						than five thousand other Mormons, who were sheltered and helped by the residents of Quincy.  By the spring of 1840, the
						Mormons were on the move north to Commerce, Hancock County which was later renamed Nauvoo.  By June 1840, Buckley and
						his family had joined their Mormon colleagues in Nauvoo.  Sally’s parents and their younger children lived nearby in Nauvoo.
					</p>	
					<p>
						During their stay in Nauvoo, Buckley and his family lived in three locations: Nauvoo Block 49, Lot 2 (likely with Buckley’s
						parents); Nauvoo Block 60, Lot 2; and Kimball 1st Block 2, Lot 55.

						<li>Son Jedediah Richmond Anderson born on April 23, 1844.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Buckley was listed on the 1842 Nauvoo City Tax List, so presumably he would have been subject to taxes. While in Nauvoo,
						Buckley worked as a Temple Stone Cutter.
					</p>
					<p>
						Two of Buckley’s siblings died during the period they were in Nauvoo.  They were:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Sister Harriet Anderson died in 1842;</li>
						<li>Brother Aaron Burr Anderson died in 1845.</li>

						Buckley and Sally participated in a LDS Endowment Ceremony on January 3, 1846 in Nauvoo.  Buckley, Sally and their three
						children departed from Nauvoo in early 1846 and eventually arrived at Winter Quarters, Nebraska Territory.

					<p>
						While in Winter Quarters, Buckley and Sally and family (Elvira, Zina Jerusha Diantha, Jedediah Richmond and Adney A C)

						Next month, Buckley and family moved to a 40 acre plot of land in Oak Township, Mills County on February 13, 1855.
						Buckley purchased these 40 acres of public lands on June 15, 1855.  The purchased public lands are identified as
						the NE¼ of NE¼ of Section 28 in Township 73 North in Range 42 West of the 5th Meridian.

						By 1856, Buckley’s father John Anderson had died sometime after 1853 likely in Mills County Iowa.  The exact
						location and timing of his death is unknown.

					<p>
						By September 1856, Buckley and family had moved to Manti in Fisher Township, Fremont County, Iowa.  Buckley
						and Sally’s oldest daughter Elvira A Anderson married Oscar Fitzland Cutler on 21 Sep 1856 at Fisher, Fremont,
						Iowa.  Oscar was second cousin to Elvira’s mother Sally.

						Sally’s father Alpheus Cutler died on June 10, 1864 at Manti.  He was buried at the Manti Cemetery.

					<p>
						The Sherman family, including Lois Cutler, moved to Oak Lake, in the fall of 1868 and they were all
						the white people in Becker County during the winter of 1868 and 1869 outside the reservation.
						Buckley and Sally received positive reports about the opportunities (likely free land), so they
						decided that it was time to move north to Minnesota as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						After Alpheus Cutler’s death in the summer of 1864, many of his followers moved north from Manti in
						Iowa to Otter Tail County in Minnesota, including Sally’s sister Lois Huntington (Cutler) Sherman
						(who’s husband was Almon Worthy Sherman) and her family.  After residing in Otter Tail County for
						three years, Almon W. Sherman moved to Becker County, arriving on Section 18 in Detroit Township
						on June 28, 1868.  Almon Sherman built a house and wintered with his family during the winter of 
						1868 and 1869 at Oak Lake, with no neighbors nearer than White Earth in one direction and the Otter
						Tail River in the other.  Almon died at Oak Lake, on December 30, 1869.

					<p>
						Buckley B. Anderson moved to Becker County, Minnesota, arriving on September 6, 1869, in Audubon
						Township with his wife and family of six children (Jedediah, Richard, Freeman, Elva, Myron and Adney),
						and settled on what became Sections 17 and 20.  Buckley’s oldest daughter Jerusha, who was the wife of
						Jackson Burdick, came with her husband and three children in the same party with the Andersons.  Burdick
						took his land also on Section 17 and 20.
					</p>
					<p>
						Lois Cutler, Alpheus’ widow, came into Becker County with her son-in-law, Almon Sherman in the year 1868.
						Cutler Alma Sherman, son of Almon and Lois Sherman, came with his parents to Detroit Township.  He resided
						on the shores of Oak Lake.  He took for his claim the east half of the northwest quarter, and the west half
						of the northeast quarter of Section 19.

					<p>
						Buckley and Sally’s son Edwin Buckley Anderson married Emma Lucine Whiting on  April 5, 1870
						at Clitherall, Otter Tail County, Minnesota.
					</p>
					<p>
						Buckley Anderson opened up a store about November 1, 1870, at his residence, which was the first store in
						what is now Audubon Township.  About the middle of December, 1870, Jedediah Anderson started a small store
						in a vacant house belonging to Mrs. Sherman on Section 18, close to the west shore of Oak Lake, in Detroit
						Township, and two or three days later another store was opened by S. B. Pinney, with Ole A. Boe for clerk,
						in another vacant house belonging to Mrs. Sherman, so by the beginning of the year 1871 there were three
						full fledged stores running full blast, in what is now Detroit Township.

					<p>
						In 1870, Lydia Anderson was residing with Erastus Cutler (grandson of Alpheus) and his family in Scott Township,
						Fremont County, Iowa.  In the early 1870s, Lydia Anderson moved to Becker County to reside with her son Buckley,
						and his family.

						A certificate was filed with the Registrar of Becker County, Minnesota dated March 15, 1876 for the purchase of
						public lands (160 acres) in Township 139 North of Range 42 West of the 5th Prime Meridian by Buckley and Sally Anderson:
					</p>
					<ol>

						Lydia Anderson died May 27, 1876 in Audubon Township, Becker County.  In 1876, when Lydia died, no cemeteries had
						been established in Audubon Township.  Cemeteries did exist in the town of Detroit and in Lake Park Township.
						It can be concluded that when Lydia Anderson died in 1876, Buckley and Sally had to decide where to bury her.
						The nearest cemetery was located in the Town of Detroit, about ten miles away.  Given the distance and time it
						would have taken to make arrangements in Detroit, it is very likely that they would choose a place much closer
						to their home for her burial.
					</p>
					<p>
						Buckley and Sally had just taken ownership of their homestead in Audubon Township.  This would make it possible
						to bury Lydia close to where they lived and later establish a cemetery on their land.   While there is no specific
						record or gravestone to confirm the location of her grave, Buckley and Sally’s subsequent actions clearly suggest
						where they buried her.  The year after she died, they established the Oakwood Cemetery, which still exists today.
						The map shows its location centered on the triangle in the road near the “A” in Anderson.
					</p>
					<p>
						In a Warranty Deed dated on October 26, 1877, Buckley B & Sally M Anderson sold to the Oakwood Cemetery Association
						for the sum of $40.00 the following land: “commencing at a stake five rods north of the south east corner of section
						17 in the township 139 of range 42 running, thence west 32 rods thence north 20 rods thence east 32 rods and thence
						south 20 rods to place of beginning and containing four acres of land”.

						Lois Cutler died at the home of her grandson, C. A. Sherman, at Oak Lake, on March 23, 1878.  Lois Cutler was buried
						in the Oakwood Cemetery in 1878. Since Lois Cutler died in 1878 at Oak Lake, where she lived with her grandson, it is
						unlikely they established this cemetery for her, but rather used it as a burial location.  I believe that it would be
						reasonable to conclude that Lydia Anderson is buried beside Lois Cutler at Oakwood Cemetery.  Lois Cutler’s grave likely
						has a gravestone because of the size of her estate.
