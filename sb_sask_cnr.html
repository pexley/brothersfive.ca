						Beginning in the early spring of 1905, the Canadian Northern Railway concentrated its
						efforts on completing track-laying between Kamsack, Saskatchewan and Edmonton, Alberta
						and between Melfort and Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.

						The small but rapidly growing centre of Saskatoon was bypassed, as Canadian Northern
						decided for technical and strategic reasons to run their main line eight miles to the
						north.  Clark’s Crossing was generally considered the best place to cross the South
						Saskatchewan River, so Canadian Northern followed well–established prairie trails and
						old survey routes in selecting that location.  As well, they expected that the more
						northerly location would prevent rival companies form building into the rich farming
						areas north of Saskatoon, between the North and South Saskatchewan Rivers.

						Because the Qu’Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railway’s route was already
						established between Regina and Prince Albert, it was necessary to establish a diamond
						where the two routes crossed at Warman, Saskatchewan.  In 1906, the owners of Canadian
						Northern Railway purchased the Qu’Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railway, which
						had been leased by the Canadian Pacific Railway since its construction in the late
						1880s, thereby providing access to Saskatoon for the Canadian Northern Railway.

						With this purchase, Canadian Northern Railway became an effective competitor of the
						Canadian Pacific in Saskatchewan and made 1906 the most important year in Canadian
						Northern’s development in Saskatchewan.
					</p>
					<p>
						Canadian Northern was not only responsible for Warman’s existence, but also for the
						rapid development over its first few years and the establishment of many of the
						businesses that were quickly sprang up such as banks, stores, hotels, restaurants,
						schools and churches.
