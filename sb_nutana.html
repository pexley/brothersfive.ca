					<p>
						Nutana was Saskatoon's first settlement, a pioneer temperance colony surveyed on
						the east bank of the South Saskatchewan River in July 1883.  The name was changed
						from Saskatoon to "Nutana" when the settlement on the west side of the river,
						which developed after the railway established its depot there in 1890,
						incorporated as the Village of Saskatoon in 1901.
					</p>
					<p>
						Saskatoon began as an agricultural community.  The establishment of a business
						district around the railway facilities on the west side did not change the
						largely agricultural and residential character of the Nutana settlement.  While
						the "west side" became the "downtown", Broadway Avenue, Nutana's central business
						street, retained its "Main Street" aura with general stores, livery stables, farm
						supply stores, and lumber yards side by side with schools and churches.

						1964.
