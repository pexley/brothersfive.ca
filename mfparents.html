								The township of Girard was organized in 1881 or early in 1882. John Howard, who had arrived in Clitherall in August, 1881, circulated a petition for its organization, and the petition was granted. Various names were suggested for the new township, Harscrabble being one of them. Others suggested Andersonville, as there were seven families by the name of Anderson. But Mr. Howard liked neither of these names, so he wrote into the petition the name of "Girard," which was the name of his birthplace, Girard, Pennsylvania.

						Edwin Buckley Anderson was born July 24, 1848, at Platte City, Platte County, Missouri.
						His father was Buckley Burnham Anderson, who was born in Huron County, Ohio, January 14, 1819.
						He died July 4, 1895, at Lebeck, Cedar County, Missouri.  Buckley married to Sally Maria
						Cutler December 31, 1837 in Ray County, Missouri.  Edwin was the sixth child of Buckley
						and Sally Anderson.  His older siblings were Elvira born 1838 in Far West, Missouri; Amos
						in 1840, Zina in 1841 and Jedidiah in 1844 were born in Nauvoo, Illinois;
						and Adney born 1846 in Winter Quarters, Nebraska.  Two of Edwin’s older siblings had
						died prior to 1848; Amos in 1840, and Adney in 1847.  By 1850, the Anderson family had
						moved to Gallatin Township in Clay County, Missouri.  About 1850, Edwin’s family moved
						to Mills County, Iowa where Edwin’s brothers Richard in 1850, William in 1852 and Freeman
						in 1855 were born.  In 1855, they moved to Manti in Fisher Township, Fremont County in Iowa
						where Edwin’s siblings Elva in 1857, Clarissa in 1859, Myron in 1861 and Adney in 1864 were

						Emma Lucine Whiting was born March 8, 1853 at Silver Creek, Mills County, Iowa.  Her father,
						Francis Lewis Whiting, was born September 22, 1830 in Nelson, Portage County, Ohio.  He died
						September 11, 1909 at Clitherall, Minnesota.  Emma’s father married Ann Janette Burdick on

						Oswego County, New York.  While still living in Silver Creek Township, Emma’s sister Lucia
						Louisa was born early in 1855.  Later in 1855, Emma’s family moved to Manti in Fisher
						Township, Fremont County, Iowa where three of Emma’s siblings were born; Ella Janette in 1857,

						In the fall of 1864, Emma’s parents, and several other families rigged up their covered
						wagons and started out for their new home in Minnesota, camping by the way.  In November,
						they reached Redwing, Minnesota and were greeted with a snow storm, that night.  They decided
						that they had gone far enough until spring.  On April 6, 1865, they again took up their
						pilgrimage toward the north.  After a long trip, they came to Otter Tail Lake.  They camped
						there a day or two, then on to West Battle Lake, where they camped near the north shore,
						perhaps 3 or 4 days.  Then at last on May 6, 1865 they reached Clitherall Lake, and there
						they made their homes.  They were favoured with very good crops that first summer, considering
						the small fields and cold backward spring.  The men were able to break up, and get under
						cultivation, and the limited supply of garden seeds we had brought with them or been able to
						buy.

						In the fall of 1866, Emma’s father and family returned to Iowa, to get her Grandmother
						Burdick, so again a long trip was taken in a covered wagon.  When they reached Sidney, Iowa,
						Emma’s father rented rooms for the winter.  The next July, they were again on the road, in a
						covered wagon, on their way back to Minnesota, but they were not alone.  There were four
						covered wagons jogging along the trail, with uncles and cousins, but also two young gentlemen,
						one of them Edwin Buckley Anderson.  When at last they could see Clitherall Lake, they had
						been on the road five weeks camping by the way and sleeping in the wagons.

						On the evening of the April 5, 1870, a company of about 45 relatives and friends, gathered
						at the home of Emma’s parents, to attend the wedding of their daughter Emma to Edwin Buckley
						Anderson.  Emma taught school the summer of 1870, while Edwin busied himself with farming,
						and building their new home.  It was not what would be called a first class house with all
						modern conveniences, but a log house of one room.  Their first furniture was all home made.
						Emma’s father made the chairs, and they bought a new cook stove, and a plain set of white
						dishes.  Their first table cloths were made of unbleached muslin, and bleached by continued
						washing.  Edwin owned a yoke of oxen and a cow.  The farming furnished their bread stuff and
						vegetables, and Emma’s school wages were carefully expended for necessities, for the coming
						winter.  Their two pigs, that they were feeding to supply our winter’s meat, came up missing
						that fall.  They imagined they furnished meat for a camp of Indians, who camped for a week or
						two a half mile from them, as pig bones about their size were found near the camp after the
						Indians were gone.

						On May 29, 1871, their first child came and he was named Ernest Morell Anderson, and Emma
						thought it quite an item to learn how to keep all her work done and care for a crying baby.
					</P>
					<P>
						On November 15, 1872, their 2nd son Lewis Ethan Anderson was born.  Then, Emma had to learn
						how to care for two babies and do the other necessary work.

					<P>
						In early January 1873, Edwin and Emma experienced a massive snow storm that reached throughout
						all of Minnesota, North Dakota and Iowa.  Edwin was in the field finishing the threshing, when
						all of a sudden he knew a storm was coming.  Edwin decided to go to the village only one and a
						half miles from their home with a load of wheat.  It was only a few minutes until the snow was
						so thick in the air.  Emma could see only a few feet from the house.  It was a terrible
						blizzard and turned cold so fast and dark so soon.  Emma felt terribly anxious for how could
						Edwin see his way home when she could only see a few feet from the window.  At last, Edwin
						entered the kitchen. What a weight rolled off Emma’s mind, as her husband was at home.  Edwin
						told her that he had let the horses guide themselves while on the lake, but they were a little
						off the track when they neared the shore, but Edwin could see a lantern, so he knew they were
						off the track and swung them into it in the right place to come up the bank.  It was a fierce
						storm that lasted 3 days and nights.

					<P>
						On September 29, 1874 Emma’s parents received the last addition to their family when Francis
						Lester Whiting was born.
					</P>
					<P>
						On January 19, 1875, Edwin and Emma’s first little daughter was born.  They named her Celia
						Annette Anderson.  She was destined to remain with them but a short time. They had measles in
						the family and Emma had them and the babe took the disease from Emma.  Emma did not know that
						her baby was dangerously ill, but thought when she broke out she would be all right.  She gave
						her some sage tea to try to drive the disease out, but she would throw it up.  She seemed
						quieter one day, slept most of the time, but did not pay much attention to anything.  Next
						morning they found her dead in their bed when they awoke.  She was not quite nine months old
						when she died September 12, 1875.
					</P>
					<P>
						July 1876, came, and the grasshoppers came to their region of country, and nearly all
						vegetables were destroyed.  They saw hard times the next two years.  On July 16, 1876 their
						son Victor Rozelle Anderson was born.  They shortly moved into old town, as it was called, to
						be near Emma’s mothers, while Edwin went away to work.  Becker County, had not suffered from
						the grasshopper raid, as Otter Tail County had.  So Edwin went to his father’s region of the
						country to help thresh, thus earning enough to tide them over that winter.  Edwin’s father
						also sent them several sacks of potatoes.
					</P>
					<P>
						In the summer of 1877, the grasshoppers’ eggs began to hatch out and again the hoppers took
						their crops.  Edwin and Emma rigged up their covered wagon and moved up to Edwin’s father’s
						place for the summer and fall.  Emma’s sister Luci and her husband, Alva Murdock, and their
						sweet little Bessie, soon followed them.  They moved Edwin’s father’s shop, and Emma and her
						sister lived together while Edwin and Alva worked for the farmers and threshers at what ever
						they could find to do, and thus they were provided for.
					</P>
					<P>
						In the fall Emma’s sister and husband moved back to Clitherall.  The ensuing winter, Edwin
						and his brother Richard took a job, of tie making and wood chopping in the timber near
						Detroit, Minnesota.  They moved to the shanty in the woods the day before Christmas, and as
						Edwin had told his three little boys that they could have a Christmas tree, if they got to
						their woods camp in time, they were planning on it.  Emma insisted on Edwin cutting an
						evergreen bush, which he nailed up on the wall. Emma fixed twine around the red apples and
						hung them on the tree, also the striped sticks of candy, the red mittens, and some small
						cakes with raisins.  In the morning their three children were as pleased over their Christmas
						tree and never found the least fault with it.
					</P>
					<P>
						The snow went off early the spring of 1878.  So they moved back to Clitherall.  Edwin then
						concluded to take a homestead near East Battle Lake, on the north side and go in for himself.
						Edwin’s homestead consisted of 157.85 acres located in Section 24 of Girard Township
						(Township 133 North, Range 39 West of 5th Prime Meridian).  They built a home on their
						homestead, and managed to raise a very good garden the first year, built a pasture fence and
						a good sized log house.  Most all of the houses in the country were of logs at this time.
						Edwin was away most of the time that winter, at work in the woods.  Early in the spring he
						was home working to open up a farm on their brush land.
					</P>
					<P>
						On August 6, 1879, their daughter Alice Eugenia Anderson was born.
					</P>
					<P>
						A school district was soon organized so their three boys could attend school.  After this a
						railroad was built through their region of the country.  This made work and wages more
						plentiful for all the settlers.  On October 30, 1881, their son Edwin Byron Anderson was born.
					</P>
					<P>
						Thus the years went by.  The little church we were members of had gone down spiritually until
						they ceased to hold meetings entirely for sometime.  The grasshoppers had come in a year from
						then, and now in a few short years, they had given up holding services.
					</P>
					<P>
						On July 20, 1885, their daughter Bertha Francis Anderson was born, and they all loved their
						lively little girl who could jump so spritely when a year old, in her jumper.
					</P>
					<P>
						Edwin received his Patent for his homestead from the United States Government on May 4, 1885.
						After it was registered on July 22, 1886, Edwin and Emma sold their homestead for $1150.
						Edwin bought a fine new home, which was a blessing to Emma for 28 years or more.  In the fall
						of 1887, they moved to Missouri and located at Independence and remained there one year and a
						half.

						They rented a farm the first year and then moved onto a piece of land which Edwin had

						not very prosperous and though they worked hard and lived economically, they kept getting

					<P>
						On July 13, 1892 their twins were born.  They named them Robert Earl Anderson and Ruby Pearl
						Anderson.  When they were three months old, the family’s last cow died, so they had to buy
						milk for the twins to have enough to eat.
					</P>
					<P>
						On March 19, 1893, their house caught fire and burned to the ground.  Most of their clothing
						and bedding and other things were burned.  They moved next day into a little house a mile
						away.  A week later, Victor took very sick with sort of pneumonia and pleurisy combined.
						After being sick about a week and growing worse all the time, Victor was healed instantly
						through the administration of Elders G. Beebe and Jedd Anderson.
					</P>
					<P>
						After that they had much sickness in the family, and though they received blessings often in
						answer to prayer yet sickness would come again.  They almost despaired of ever raising Ruby,
						as she had so much sickness.  A short time before the twins were a year old, they were thrown
						out of a rig, when riding, and into a rickety ditch, or gully and Emma suffered a compound
						dislocation of her right elbow.  Doctor Marquis of Cedar Springs was summoned and he and
						Edwin’s brother Jedd, managed after the 5th trial, which caused her great pain, to set the
						elbow back into the proper place.  It was a week before Emma could move a finger of her hand,
						three weeks before she could commence to squeeze a dishcloth in her hand so as to help wash
						dishes, six weeks before she could help wash.  For all these six weeks Victor, who was about
						17 and Alice, who was 14, would each take a tub and board and work hard all one day in every
						week to get the week’s washing done.
					</P>
					<P>
						Lewis was in Minnesota to find work at that time.  Ernest went into Indian Territory, or
						Oklahoma to work.  That fall of 1893, Edwin was sick for a while; both twins were sick,
						Victor was sick again and again and was healed through the administration of the Elders.
						That fall or early part of winter, Lewis, came home on a visit and he took a sick spell, when
						he got better he advised them to go back to Minnesota.  Edwin found a chance to sell his 40
						acres for $250 on February 21, 1894.  He took the most of it in horses and colts, so he rigged
						up two covered wagons, and on May 17, 1894, and they started on a pilgrimage again to
						Minnesota.  Edwin’s father Buckley and his brothers Jedidiah and Myron remained in Cedar
						County.
					</P>
					<P>
						Ernest was still in Oklahoma, and Lewis had returned to Minnesota, so there were nine members
						in the family.  When they were two weeks on the road, they found that their five youngest
						children had been exposed to whooping cough, as they had begun to whoop, and they had whooping
						times from then on.  They were about six weeks on the road.  Emma was very glad to meet her
						parents, brothers and sisters, and other relatives again when they arrived in Clitherall.
					</P>
					<P>
						They moved into a house which was vacant, and stayed that summer and winter.  Edwin and sons
						worked at whatever their hands found to do.  On February 22, 1895, they celebrated
						Washington’s Birthday by another burnout.  They lost lots of bedding and clothing in this
						fire.  After these fires, their kind friends and neighbours came to their relief with many
						needful things, which they greatly appreciated.
					</P>
					<P>
						On July 4, 1895, Edwin’s father Buckley Burnham Anderson died and was buried in Lebeck
						Cemetery, Missouri.
					</P>
					<P>
						The summer of 1895, they rented a farm of Orris Albertson and raised a fine crop.  The
						children and Emma tried to help all they could.  They crawled over the onion field time after
						time with the children's helping to pull weeds.  In the fall they had to put 40 bushel of
						onions in an out door cellar because there was no sale for them.  The next spring Edwin had
						to take them all out and dump them on the ground, because there was no sale.
					</P>
					<P>
						Their potatoes, which the children and Emma worked so faithfully to help dig and cellar, were
						partly fed to the cows and a few sold for 10¢ a bushel.  In the spring their wheat brought
						about 40¢ a bushel, still they had plenty to eat and lived some way.  The next year they
						rented the St. Pierre farm north of Battle Lake.  Crops were poor this year too.  The next
						year they rented a small farm of Alva Murdock.  In 1898 and 1899 they rented the Ricker farm

						In the fall of 1899, they moved to Bemidji, Minnesota over 100 miles north.  Their daughter
						had taught a term of school near Deer Creek, and this summer had taught near Buena Vista in
						Beltrami County.  Their sons Ernest and Victor and Edwin’s brothers Freeman and Myron had
						taken homesteads near Bemidji, so they moved up there and lived on Victor's homestead.
					</P>
					<P>
						In May 1900, they were pleased to have Emma’s parents, her sister Lucia who was now a widow,
						and her youngest sister Corda, and her husband and family visit them.
					</P>
					<P>
						They worked hard at Bemidji, but began to have more for their comfort.  Lewis came from the
						Philippines, for which they were glad.  The men worked at wood hauling and chopping in the
						winter and trying to get farms open in the Jack pine regions in the summer.  Their home was
						always open to the missionaries, and they were pleased to have them.  Here Edwin, was ordained
						a Priest.
					</P>
					<P>
						On June 10, 1900, their oldest son Ernest, was married to Miss Lilly Hand, and their oldest
						daughter Alice was united in marriage with Leon Gould at their home.  Leon and Alice soon
						left for Lamoni, Iowa where Leon took up the work of stenography for the Patriarch.  Alice
						wrote faithfully of how kind Aunt Lizzie Smith was to her when she went as a bride and
						stranger to a strange land.  Ernest and his bride soon went to housekeeping on his homestead,
						as Edwin and Emma’s family began to dwindle.
					</P>
					<P>
						In 1901, Freeman Anderson and family and Edwin and Emma, and their daughters Bertha, Grace,
						and Ruby and their son Robert, went with teams and covered wagons to Clitherall, to the
						reunion.  When they returned home from the reunion they found Alice and Leon there.  Leon
						left in a few days to start on a long mission to Australia, leaving his wife with them.  That
						fall Leon’s only brother Winfield (always called Winnie) died with typhoid fever, at his
						parent’s home in Otter Tail County.

						Alice wrote to Leon every week and received letters from him often, but he could not get her
						letters as he was going from one island to another.  His mail could never catch up with him,
						until he reached Australia.  While on one of the Islands, the missionaries were warned through
						the gifts of the Holy Spirit, of sorrow awaiting some of their number.  Leon of course would
						wonder if it could be Alice.  Their little daughter Alice Leona was born November 28, 1901,
						at their home.  It was way into January 1902, before Leon got the letters, telling him about
						his new little daughter.  He heard of his brother’s death while reading the Ensign.  In March,
						Alice and baby left them to visit their relations in Clitherall.  While there the baby was
						healed of a terrible affliction of eczema, or something like it, through administration of
						the Elders.  When Leon came home they went to Lamoni to live.  Bertha and Lewis went there
						soon to work, for Alice, at the Saints home for the aged.
					</P>
					<P>
						Time passed on, their son Victor, their nephew Ross Anderson, and John Hedeen, a neighbour,
						went to Canada, and took homesteads, about 20 miles south and west of Saskatoon, North-West
						Territories.  In the winter of 1904, Victor, returned on a visit, and married Miss Anna
						Hedeen.  They went immediately to their Canadian home, but she only lived a few months.  She
						died of a blind tumour, or the effects of the operation, by doctors to remove it.  Thus
						trouble comes so unexpected.  In the early winter of 1905, Victor returned to Minnesota and
						worked near home all winter.
					</P>
					<P>
						Emma was shown in a dream that they would go to Canada soon.  A new railroad was built near
						their house.  They boarded a dozen or more hands for nearly three months.  Then Victor
						chartered a car to take their stock and household effects to Canada.  Ernest and wife and
						little Thelma, (they had lost their first baby boy named Lester Lawrence) started for
						Portland, Oregon where Lilly's mother lived the same day they started for Canada.  On
						April 12, 1905, they boarded the train about 3:00 AM on Wednesday morning.  By 11:00 PM
						Thursday evening they were at brother Richard Anderson's home.  They got to Saskatoon about
						6:00 PM and hired a rig to take them out 20 miles, so they were good and tired when they got
						there at 11:00 PM that night.  Next day they drove over to Victor's home and so were at home
						in a strange land.

						The next Monday, Victor reached Saskatoon, with the car.   Their boys Byron and Victor, Uncle
						Rich and John Hedeen, all went with teams to help haul the effects, and drive the cows to
						their place.  Edwin filed on a homestead, joining Victors.  From the first, Emma loved their
						Canadian home.  About the third Sunday after reaching there, they started a Sunday school.
						The next winter a Branch was organized.  Edwin was elected president, he had been ordained a
						priest while at Bemidji, and later and Elder at a Clitherall reunion.

						Edwin and Emma’s homestead, which was identified as SE ¼ of Section 22 in Township 34 North
						and Range 7 West of the 3rd Prime Meridian, was first entered May 31, 1905.  They were finally
						able to move into their new 24’ by 30’ frame and log house, which was started in June 1905,
						worth $600 after it was completed in October 1905.  They broke 20 acres and cropped 5 acres
						of their homestead that first summer.  Over the next three years, they broke an additional
						63 acres, and by 1908 they cropped 67 acres.  They also built a 25’ by 28’ barn worth $100
						to house their livestock.  They also fenced 30 acres and built a granary.  Having met all
						requirements, their homestead was finally officially turned over to them by the Department of
						the Interior on December 4, 1908.
					</P>
					<P>
						They did the best they could, with their limited means, they worked and prayed and trusted.
						Their children left home for homes of their own.  Ernest's dear wife died at Dayton,
						Washington on December 13, 1906.  The next March, Ernest and little three and a half year old
						Thelma, came to live with them in Canada.  Their daughter Grace married Omar Nunn on September
						4, 1907.  Ross Anderson married their daughter Bertha on April 12, 1909.  Victor married Miss
						Jennie Leach on May 30, 1909 at Edwin and Emma’s house.  Their son Byron married Miss Nora
						Hourie on May 8, 1911.  Lewis married Miss Addie Caress on November 29, 1911.  The number was
						decreasing in their home, but increasing in their children's homes.

						In the spring of 1909, Leon and Alice and their four children, and Lewis had left Lamoni,
						Iowa and went to or near Bemidji, Minnesota to live.  Emma had relatives near there and also
						at Clitherall.  It had been nearly five years since Emma had seen any of them.  Emma had
						wished to make a visit to Minnesota in the early winter or late fall of 1909.  About the same
						time a young man whose homestead joined theirs, and who had stayed with them a good deal,
						until he seemed one of the family, heard that his mother was sick, who lived near Bemidji,
						too.  He was to start for Minnesota the last of the week.  Edwin bought a return ticket for
						Emma for about $31.00.  He thought Emma could stay about three months and Lewis would be ready
						to come home with her, as he intended to go to Canada in the spring.

						About 1:00 PM, they entered the train.  Emma thought to herself, I don't know when I have
						felt so well as this whole afternoon.  As soon as the train had left Saskatoon, she was
						hungry, and enjoyed her meal.  They reached Bemidji, Monday forenoon, took dinner at a
						restaurant.  John Hedeen hired a rig, to take them and their trunks out into the country.
						They reached his mothers first, and found her better, then on to Leon's and Alice's.  They
						did not know Emma was coming, so she took them by surprise.  When Emma told Lewis her plans,
						he said he could not get ready to go to Canada, by the first of March.  Emma wrote home and
						asked her husband to try and make it possible for him to come down and make a visit that
						winter. She thought it would be terrible to have to go so far alone.  When Edwin wrote to
						Emma, he said he would think of it but feared he could not make it.

						Emma stayed at Alice's all through December, except nearly every Sunday Lewis and Emma would
						go over to Freeman Anderson home and visit her sister May, and go to church, which was held
						at the school house or in private dwellings.  New Years Day passed, and 1910, was ushered in,
						how she looked all day for her husband.  She thought, if he does come at all, he will come
						before the New Year.  How disappointed she did feel to think Edwin wasn't here to go with her
						down to Clitherall, and to visit all round and go home with her.  When they reached the school
						house May made Emma go in first, and when she got into the inner door, she stopped speechless
						for there sat a man who’s back looked just like Edwin.  She couldn't believe her eyes, until
						he turned his head and she knew it was him.  Then she rushed over to him and shook his hand,
						and said right out loud in Sunday school, "Oh, they didn't let me know you had come."  How
						everyone laughed at her then, all knowing how surprised and pleased she was.  That was one of
						her happiest days.  It seemed that the children, back at home had all combined to encourage
						him to come.  He wanted to come, but feared it would not be wise.

						going to try to feel as sister Lu told us to, as if I am not leaving for good, but am coming
						back."  "Well", Edwin said, "that's a good way to feel if you can think so."  She thought to

						their daughter, Alice, goodby, oh what a look of sadness came over Edwin’s face, and Emma
