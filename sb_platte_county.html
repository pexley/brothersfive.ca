						Platte County, Missouri was formed in 1838. Named for the Platte River, the
						principal river of the county.  It rises in Nodaway County, flows south, and
						empties into the Missouri River.  The Lewis and Clark Journal has this entry:
						"...passed the mouth of a small river ten miles above the Kansas called by the
						French Petite River Platte (or Shoal River), from the number of falls in it."
						The French compared it to the larger Platte River of Nebraska. Locally it was not
						known as the Little Platte. The name Platte for both rivers has the sense
						indicated by Lewis and Clark of "shoal" or shallow, which is eminently
						characteristic of either stream.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the time of its organization, it had its present boundaries: Buchanan County
						on the north, Clinton and Clay Counties on the east. The Missouri River separates
						it on the south and west from the state of Kansas.
					</p>
					<p>
						On November 16,1839 at a meeting at Martinsville, it was decided by a board of
						commissioners that the Falls of Platte (later Platte City) be the seat of justice
						in Platte County. The Platte County Court approved this site as the location of the
						County Seat on December 4, 1839, due to its central location and officially named
						the site Platte City. Thus, in the spring of 1840, the town of Martinsville moved
						over into what is now known as Platte City.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first circuit court was held at the log cabin of M.D. Faylor in the Falls of
						Platte on March 25,1839. Construction on the first county courthouse was started
						in September 1840. It was completed and opened for use in December 1842. The original
						courthouse was located one block west of where the current courthouse resides.
						It stood about where Wellsbrook Antiques, the Landmark and Farley Law Office
						are located. It was a two-story building costing $15,000 to build. Church services
						of all denominations were held on the second floor. Chairs were by subscription and
 						helped pay the cost of the building. The first church to erect it's own building was
						the Methodist in 1848, followed by the Baptist in 1850, the Christian, in 1855 and the
						Catholic, in 1870. The Presbyterian had organized in 1843 and shared the Methodist
						Church building for services.
					</p>
					<p>
						Platte City was incorporated as a city in September 1843. A charter was obtained from
						the Legislature in 1845 for Platte City. At this time Main Street was graded and sidewalks laid.

						Buckley B Anderson and his family moved to Platte County, Missouri about 1847.  Buckley
						and family had left Nauvoo, Illinois in 1846 as part of the	Mormon Exodus traveling to Winter
						Quarters (later known as Florence, near Omaha, Nebraska), before returning to Missouri,
						settling in to Platte City, Platte County.
						By 1850, Buckley and family were living in Gallatin Township, Clay County, Missouri.
