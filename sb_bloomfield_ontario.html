						The Phelps and Gorham Purchase was the purchase in 1788 of the pre-emptive right to some 6,000,000 acres
						(24,000 km²) of land in western New York State for $1,000,000. This was all land in western New York west
						of Seneca Lake between Lake Ontario and the Pennsylvania border. The purchasers were Oliver Phelps and
						Nathaniel Gorham, both of Massachusetts, and the seller was the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Although
						Phelps and Gorham purchased pre-emptive rights to all 6,000,000 acres, they were only able to extinguish
						Indian rights — and obtain clear title — to the portion east of the Genesee River.  That area was devided
						into six by six mile squares numbered south to north as Townships one to fourteen and from east to west
						as Ranges one to seven.

						On January 27, 1789, Ontario County was created and its inhabited portion organized into provisional districts,
						or towns with an incompleted civil jurisdiction. One of these was called Bloomfield, which was located in Township
						10 in Range 4 and partial Range 5, and included within its boundaries all that is now Mendon, Victor and East and
						West Bloomfield. The two towns first mentioned were taken off in 1812, and West Bloomfield in 1833. The latter
						creation necessitated a change in the name of the mother town, hence it was called East Bloomfield.

						Sally Maria's family lived in Bloomfield Township from about 1817 though 1822.  Sally Amria's grandparents Knight
						and Elizabeth Cutler also live in Bloomfield Township around the same time.
