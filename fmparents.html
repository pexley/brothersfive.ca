						Margaret Thomas was born May 1, 1860 at 54 Mundy Street in Saint Alkmund’s parish in Derby,
						Derbyshire.  Her parents Robert Thomas and Elizabeth Wright registered her birth May 31, 1860.
						Margaret’s parents were married September 7, 1840 in Taunton, Somerset.  Her father Robert
						Thomas was born about 1814 in Stanton Newhall, Derbyshire.  Her mother Elizabeth Wright was
						born about 1819 in Manchester, Lancashire.  Margaret was the youngest of their five children.
					</p>
					<p>
						Margaret’s four siblings were Emma, Hannah, Mary and Robert.  Her father was a hawker who sold
						T. G. Greens earthenware over a large area of England, and as a result, his children were born
						in a variety of locations.  Emma was born in Yeovil, Somerset in early 1843 at the Half Moon
						Public House.  Hannah was born in Williton, Somerset on December 22, 1846 at one of the local
						public houses.  Mary was born in Derby, Derbyshire in the summer of 1849.  Robert was born in
						Newhall, Derbyshire in the summer of 1857.
					</p>
					<p>
						Margaret lived with her parents and her siblings in Derby until her father’s death.  Robert
						Thomas died (age 52) on December 25, 1867 at Greyhound Yard, Friargate in Derby, Derbyshire.
						His death was registered by his daughter Mary Thomas.
					</p>
					<p>
						Soon after his death, Margaret and her mother Elizabeth moved to Middle Road, Westtown in
						Dewsbury, where they lived with Isaac Banks.  At a very young age, Margaret Thomas became a
						servant at the George Cooper residence down Middle Road two houses from where Isaac and
						Elizabeth lived.

						Margaret’s mother Elizabeth Banks died in September 1875 on Manor Road in Dewsbury.  She was
						buried on September 20, 1875, at age 59 years.  She is buried in Public Grave G349 in the
						Consecrated Section of Dewsbury County Cemetery.  Margaret continued to live with her
						step-father Isaac Banks in Westtown.
					</p>
					<p>
						By 1877, Margaret had developed a relationship with Thomas Imeson, who had moved from
						Driffield in East Yorkshire to Earlsheaton, a village close to Dewsbury. Thomas was a
						cordwainer, making boots for the Earlsheaton mineworkers.  Thomas Imeson was born November
						6, 1856 on Washington Street in Great Driffield.  His parents were Philip Imeson and Hannah
						Creaser.  Philip was born May 13, 1827 in Middleton on the Wolds in East Yorkshire.  He was a
						journeyman shoemaker.  Hannah was born December 29, 1822 in Flamborough in East Yorkshire.
						Philip and Hannah were married May 26, 1851 in Great Driffield.  Thomas was the fourth of six
						children.
					</p>
					<p>
						Margaret planned to marry Thomas, but because she was only 18 years of age when she planned
						to marry, she needed her parents’ consent.  Since both her father Robert and her mother
						Elizabeth had already died, that left her step-father Isaac Banks to give permission for
						Margaret to marry.  Margaret Thomas (age 18) and Thomas Imeson (age 19) married February 17,
						1878 at the Parish Church in Dewsbury.  Isaac Banks witnessed the marriage, continuing his
						role as Margaret’s step-father.  Isaac Banks died (age 55) on December 21, 1878 at the Union
						Workhouse in Dewsbury.  He is buried in Public Grave H706 in the Consecrated Section of
						Dewsbury County Cemetery.
					</p>

						Margaret and Thomas made their home in Earlsheaton, relatively close to Thomas’s mineworker
						customers.

						Margaret was a widow with two children at age 21.  About a year later, she began a
						relationship with widower Charles Flowers from the Thornhill area.  Charles and his twin
						brother Joseph were born March 23, 1854 at Hall Green, Crigglestone.  His parents were George
						Flower and Mary Ann Cooper.  Charles had married his first wife, Ann Exley, on January 21,

					<p>
						Charles and Margaret got to know many of the families who lived on Walker Street and became

						William Carruthers’ wife Annie died leaving William a widower.  Even though it had been three
						years since her husband Charles had died, Margaret could fully understand what William was feeling.
						As a result, Margaret was able to console William and help him with his grief, leading a very close
						relationship.  Margaret (age 41) married William Carruthers, who was age 46, at the Dewsbury Registrar
						Office on September 29, 1900.  They continued to live on Ingham Road in Thornhill Lees where William worked.

						(age 25) married Sam Exley (age 21) at the Dewsbury Registrar Office.  Emily and Sam then moved to 4 Forest Cottages
						on Lees Hall Road in Thornhill Lees.  Later that year, Emily and Sam had their first child named Percy Scott Exley
						born November 4, 1907 in Thornhill Lees.  Sam continued to work at Providence Glass Works while Emily looked after
						her baby.  About two years later, Emily and Sam had their second child named William born November 13, 1909 in Thornhill
						Lees.  Sam and Emily, along with their two children immigrated to Canada in March 1910.  Sam’s step-father Edmund Watson
						had arranged for a job working for the railway as section man.  On March 10, 1910, they left Liverpool on the S. S.
						Tunisian of the Allan Lines, the same ship that Sam’s step-father had taken, and arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia
						March 18, 1910.  The family traveled by train from Halifax to Warman, Saskatchewan to join his parents Edmund and Ann Watson.

						William Flowers decided that he should visit Canada, to visit with his sister and best friend Sam Exley.  He departed Liverpool
						on May 13, 1910 on the SS Megantic, a White Star Dominion liner.  He arrived in Montreal about eight days later.  He traveled by
						train via Winnipeg to Warman Saskatchewan where he met up with Sam Exley and his sister Emily.  He very quickly had a job with the

						By the later part of 1910, Margaret was receiving glowing reports from William and Emily encouraging them to move to Canada
						as well.  So on December 9, 1910, Margaret sold her two houses located on Ingham Road, Thornhill Lees, and made arrangements
						to immigrate to Canada early in 1911.  William Carruthers was torn, as he hated to leave his own children behind, but he also
						wanted to stay with Margaret.  He eventually decided to stay, and move back with his children on Walker Street.  Her son
						Philip and his wife Annie had also remained in England.  Margaret and four of her remaining off-spring journeyed to Liverpool
						to board the Empress of Britain on February 11, 1911, for their trip to Canada.  They arrived in Saint John, New Brunswick on
						February 18, 1911.  When they arrived in Saint John, Margaret’s health had deteriorated and she became very ill.  As a result,
						she was not well enough to continue on to Lumsden, Saskatchewan where Emily and her family lived.  She was also too ill to return
						to England, so she stayed in Saint John until her health improved.  The family stayed in Saint John for more than six weeks while
						she recovered from her illness.  During the family’s stay in Saint John, Margaret decided that when she was well enough to travel,
						she would return to England instead of finishing her trip to Lumsden.  She encouraged her sons George and Joseph and her daughter
						Lily to finish their trip west to Saskatchewan.  On April 6, 1911, Margaret and her youngest son Arthur boarded the Empress of
						Ireland for their return trip to Liverpool.  They traveled third class arriving in Liverpool April 15, 1911.  On their return home
						William Carruthers was thrilled to see them.  He was still working for Kilner Brothers at the Providence Glass Works in Thornhill Lees.
						After their return, William and Margaret and the family lived at Prospect Terrace at 49 Brewery Lane in Thornhill Lees.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Flowers’ siblings did decide to stay in Canada.  They boarded a train for the long journey to Lumsden, Saskatchewan, a distance
						of over 2600 miles to reunite with William and Emily.  Soon after arriving in Lumsden, Margaret’s three adult sons, George, William
						and Joseph moved to Warman, Saskatchewan to work beside Edmund and Charles William Watson as section men for the Canadian Northern
						Railway.  Lily remained in Lumsden with her sister Emily and her family.  Later they moved to Saskatoon.

						By the autumn of 1911, the Flowers’ siblings were missing their homeland, and decided to return to Yorkshire as soon as they could
						make arrangements.  Emily’s mother-in-law Ann Watson decided that she would travel with them to visit family still living in England.
						They traveled by train to Quebec City, and sailed back to Liverpool on the Empress of Britain.  They departed on November 3, 1911 and
						arrived in Liverpool on November 10, 1911.  It was a rough crossing.  They arrived back home in Thornhill Lees virtually penniless.
						They later learned that the Empress of Ireland had collided with another ship and sank in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and recalled that
						Margaret and Arthur had took that same ship three years earlier.

						William Flowers decided to travel back to Canada about a year after returning.  He departed Liverpool April 26, 1913 on the Laurentic
						and arrived in Quebec City May 7, 1913.  He traveled to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on the Canadian Northern Railway.  Besides visiting
						Sam and Emily, he helped Sam build a house in South Saskatoon that summer and autumn.  During the two winters William Flowers had
						spent in Canada, he experienced the most severe conditions, nearly freezing to death.  They lived in two log cabins miles from anywhere.
						The cabins had a cord between them which was used as a primitive telephone.  Native Indians used to beg food and water from them which
						was frightening.  The cabins had a hole dug in the floor where food stuffs were stored and kept cool in clay.  A bear entered the cabin
						on one occasion and stole the butter out of this hole in the floor and set about feeding itself on the porch.  Sam Exley shot at it with
						a gun and the bear ran away.  The winters were so cold that the Mounties used to push people along if they stopped so that they would not
						freeze.  William had difficulty adjusting to this severe climate.  As the summer of 1914 neared, William was missing England and his family
						and decided that it was time to go home.  He traveled by train back to Montreal, sailing on the Megantic July 4, 1914 and arriving in
						Liverpool on July 12, 1914. enroute to his home in Yorkshire.  This was his last visit to Canada and the last time he visited his sister.
