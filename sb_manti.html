						Manti was formed in 1852 by Alpheus Cutler and his followers.  As part of the great Mormon Exodus
						from Nauvoo in 1846, Alpheus and his followers decided that they would not follow the main group
						to the Great Salt Lake, but rather settle at what became Manti, Iowa.  About 40 families finally
						constituted the Manti settlement.
