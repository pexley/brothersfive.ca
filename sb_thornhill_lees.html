					<p>
						Thornhill Lees was a village and ecclesiastical parish formed in 1859 from the 
						parishes of Dewsbury and Thornhill located one mile south from Dewsbury.  The 
						church of the Holy Innocents was a building in early decorated style, erected in 
						1858, consisting of chancel, nave with clerestory, and a tower surrounded by an 
						elegant spire, forming a most picturesque view.  Savile Town, an entirely modern 
						district, of increasing importance, lay immediately adjacent to Dewsbury, on the 
						opposite side of the river Calder.  There was a stone bridge of three arches, each 
						with a span of 50 feet, which was erected in 1862, in order to connect the Savile 
						estate with Dewsbury, and a 60 feet wide street leading to Thornhill Lees station 
						on the Lancashire and Yorkshire railway line.
