						On February 7, 1809, the State of Ohio authorized the creation of Huron County. Residents named
						the county after the Huron Indians. The county was originally a portion of the Connecticut Western
						Reserve and was also part of the Fire Lands. Huron County is located in the north-central portion of Ohio.

						The original name of Berlin Township was Eldridge, from one of its earliest proprietors.  He became unpopular,
						so much so that in 1832 the people petitioned the commissioners of Huron county to change the name, stating as
						a reason that they did not desire to perpetuate the name of an unworthy man.  It seems the people were mistaken,
						for those intimately acquainted with Mr. Eldridge remember him as a pleasant gentleman.  He purchased the eastern
						half of the township as a speculation, and the taxes, imposed unequally, rested so heavily on unimproved lands,
						improvements being exempted, that he was unable to pay his taxes, and was ruined by owning a half of one of the
						best townships on the Firelands.  Rumors came from Connecticut that he had been guilty of forgery to redeem his
						credit, and possibly the innate hatred the settler felt toward the land speculator, was at the root of the popular
						sentiment. The petitioners suggested Lyme as a desirable name, but as there was already a town by the same name in
						the county, - it then being a part of Huron county,- the commissioners objected. It was at the time of the
						Milan-Berlin treaty.  Noah Hill, who always was deeply interested in polities, suggested that, as the county had
						Milan, it should have Berlin, too, and thus the town was named.

						On March 15, 1838, the Ohio government authorized the creation of Erie County. The county was originally parts of
						Huron and Sandusky Counties. Residents named the county after the Erie Indians. The county was originally a portion
						of the Connecticut Western Reserve and was part of the Fire Lands. Located on Lake Erie, the county and its residents
						played an important role in the Underground Railroad during the first part of the nineteenth century. Residents commonly
						ferried runaway slaves across Lake Erie to Canada. Sandusky and Huron were once busy ports, allowing Ohio farmers and
						businesses to ship their products all over the world.
