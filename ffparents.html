						By 1901, Edmund, Ann and their sons were living on 10 Lees Grove in Thornhill Lees, just south

						Warman was a railroad town at the junction of two main lines with plenty of opportunity for

					<p>
						William Flowers decided that he should travel to Canada, to visit with his sister and best
						friend Sam Exley.  He departed Liverpool on May 14, 1910 on the SS Megantic, a White Star
						Dominion liner.  He arrived in Montreal about eight days later.  He traveled by train via
						Winnipeg to Warman, Saskatchewan where he met up with Sam Exley and his sister Emily.  He very
						quickly had a job with the Canadian Northern Railway where Sam worked.

					<p>
						By early 1911, Sam Exley and his family and William Flowers had been transferred to Lumsden,
						Saskatchewan just north-west of Regina.  In April, William and Emily’s three siblings George,
						Joseph and Lily arrived in Lumsden from Saint John, New Brunswick.  They had departed Saint
						John after an extended stay when their mother and youngest brother Arthur had boarded the
						Empress of Ireland for their return trip to England.  George and Joseph Flowers soon had a job
						with the Canadian Northern Railway as section men.  By June 1911, the three Flowers’ brothers
						were transferred to Warman, where they made contact with the Edmund, Ann and Willie Watson.
						Lily remained living with her sister Emily.  She helped Emily with looking after the kids as

						By the autumn of 1911, the Flowers’ siblings were missing their homeland, and decided to

						would travel with them to visit family still living in England.  They traveled by train to
						Quebec City, and sailed back to Liverpool on the Empress of Britain.  They departed on
						November 3, 1911 and arrived in Liverpool on November 10, 1911.  It was a rough crossing.
						They arrived back home in Thornhill Lees virtually penniless.  They later learned that the
						Empress of Ireland had collided with another ship and sank in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence,
						and recalled that Margaret and Arthur had took that same ship three years earlier.

						In 1912, Edmund was working as a signalman for the Canadian Pacific Railway and residing in
						Sutherland, just east of Saskatoon.  A year after Ann had gone to visit England, Edmund
						decided it was time for his own visit to his homeland.  Edmund and Willie took the train from
						Saskatoon to Montreal.  They departed Montreal on the SS Magantic on November 22, 1912 and
						arrived in Liverpool December 1, 1912.  They were able to visit family and friends, and of
						course catch-up with Ann.  They remained in England for the winter and returned to Canada the
						next spring.  On April 19, 1913, Edmund and Ann Watson departed from Liverpool and the SS
