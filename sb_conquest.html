						Conquest is a village located in the Rural Municipality of Fertile Valley in
						Saskatchewan about 60 miles southwest of Saskatoon and 128 miles northwest of
						Moose Jaw.  The village was erected in 1911, the same year that the Canadian
						Northern and Canadian Pacific Railways finished laying their tracks to Conquest.

						The first settlers to the Fertile Valley area began to arrive in 1904 by way of
						Saskatoon. They traveled in wagons, with horses and oxen, following the old 'Bone
						Trail' made by the Indians to where Delisle now is.  They then followed a new
						trail that closely paralleled the C.N.R. through Donavon, Swanson and Ardath.
						Between 1905 and 1910, many more settlers arrived. The early settlers were mostly
						from Ontario and Manitoba, with the occasional one from England, Ireland and
						Scotland.  In 1910, both the C.P.R and C.N.R. were interested in getting in a road
						and numerous surveys were made and stakes set out.  The C.P.R. purchased a town
						site on the NW 1/4 of 32-29-9-W3.  Eventually a store was erected as well as other
						buildings and a doctor's office.  In April 1911, the first mail arrived at the
						Conquest Post Office in a three decked wagon box.

						The Village of Conquest was erected a village under The Village Act on October
						24, 1911. In April 1922, P.H. Kennedy planted a tree belt on his land, convinced
						that this would help the farmers in fighting drought and blowing. In the early
						1930's, he submitted his tree planting idea to the Minister of Agriculture. Since
						then, Mr. Kennedy was known as 'the father of the shelterbelts'. Conquest and area
						is made up of many shelterbelts consisting of caraganas, thus Conquest being named
						the Caragana Capital.
